019:012 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
        fled, and escaped.

019:013 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
        pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a
        cloth.

019:014 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is
        sick.

019:015 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring
        him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

019:016 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an
        image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his
        bolster.

019:017 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
        sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered
        Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?

019:018 So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and
        told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went
        and dwelt in Naioth.

019:019 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in
        Ramah.

019:020 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
        company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as
        appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers
        of Saul, and they also prophesied.

019:021 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
        prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third
        time, and they prophesied also.

019:022 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is
        in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David?
        And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

019:023 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
        was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he
        came to Naioth in Ramah.

019:024 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
        Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all
        that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the
        prophets?

020:001 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
        Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is
        my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

020:002 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold,
        my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he
        will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from
        me? it is not so.

020:003 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly
        knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith,
        Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as
        the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step
        between me and death.

020:004 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
        will even do it for thee.

020:005 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new
        moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but
        let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third
        day at even.

020:006 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
        leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there
        is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

020:007 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but
        if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by
        him.

020:008 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou
        hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with
        thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me
        thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?

020:009 And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew
        certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon
        thee, then would not I tell it thee?

020:010 Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy
        father answer thee roughly?

020:011 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the
        field. And they went out both of them into the field.

020:012 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I
        have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third
        day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then
        send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

020:013 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my
        father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send
        thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with
        thee, as he hath been with my father.

020:014 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness
        of the LORD, that I die not:

020:015 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for
        ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David
        every one from the face of the earth.

020:016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying,
        Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.

020:017 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved
        him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

020:018 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and
        thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

020:019 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
        quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself
        when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone
        Ezel.

020:020 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I
        shot at a mark.

020:021 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the
        arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows
        are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there
        is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.

020:022 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
        beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.

020:023 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
        behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.

020:024 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
        come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

020:025 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
        seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's
        side, and David's place was empty.

020:026 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he
        thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely
        he is not clean.

020:027 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
        the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto
        Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to
        meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?

020:028 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me
        to go to Bethlehem:

020:029 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a
        sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to
        be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let
        me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he
        cometh not unto the king's table.

020:030 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
        unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I
        know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own
        confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?

020:031 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou
        shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send
        and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.

020:032 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
        Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?

020:033 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan
        knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.

020:034 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat
        no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for
        David, because his father had done him shame.

020:035 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out
        into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little
        lad with him.

020:036 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
        shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

020:037 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
        Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is
        not the arrow beyond thee?

020:038 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not.
        And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
        master.

020:039 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew
        the matter.

020:040 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto
        him, Go, carry them to the city.

020:041 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
        toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and
        bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and
        wept one with another, until David exceeded.

020:042 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
        sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be
        between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for
        ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the
        city.

021:001 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech
        was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art
        thou alone, and no man with thee?

021:002 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath
        commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man
        know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and
        what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants
        to such and such a place.

021:003 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
        bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

021:004 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common
        bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the
        young men have kept themselves at least from women.

021:005 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
        women have been kept from us about these three days, since I
        came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the
        bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified
        this day in the vessel.

021:006 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread
        there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD,
        to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

021:007 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
        detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite,
        the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

021:008 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under
        thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword
        nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required
        haste.

021:009 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom
        thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped
        in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it:
        for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is
        none like that; give it me.

021:010 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went
        to Achish the king of Gath.

021:011 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David
        the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him
        in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
        his ten thousands?

021:012 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore
        afraid of Achish the king of Gath.

021:013 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
        mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
        and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.

021:014 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
        wherefore then have ye brought him to me?

021:015 Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to
        play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into
        my house?

022:001 David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave
        Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house
        heard it, they went down thither to him.

022:002 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
        debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves
        unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were
        with him about four hundred men.

022:003 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
        king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come
        forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.

022:004 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt
        with him all the while that David was in the hold.

022:005 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
        depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David
        departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.

022:006 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that
        were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in
        Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were
        standing about him;)

022:007 Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear
        now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of
        you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of
        thousands, and captains of hundreds;

022:008 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none
        that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
        Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or
        sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against
        me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

022:009 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the
        servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to
        Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

022:010 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals,
        and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

022:011 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
        Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in
        Nob: and they came all of them to the king.

022:012 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
        Here I am, my lord.

022:013 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou
        and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a
        sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise
        against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

022:014 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so
        faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's
        son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in
        thine house?

022:015 Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me:
        let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all
        the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all
        this, less or more.

022:016 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
        all thy father's house.

022:017 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
        and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is
        with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not
        shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put
        forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.

022:018 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the
        priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the
        priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that
        did wear a linen ephod.

022:019 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of
        the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and
        oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

022:020 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
        Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.

022:021 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's
        priests.

022:022 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg
        the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have
        occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.

022:023 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
        seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

023:001 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
        against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

023:002 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and
        smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and
        smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.

023:003 And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
        Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the
        armies of the Philistines?

023:004 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD
        answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will
        deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

023:005 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
        Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them
        with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of
        Keilah.

023:006 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled
        to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his
        hand.

023:007 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
        said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut
        in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

023:008 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
        Keilah, to besiege David and his men.

023:009 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against
        him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the
        ephod.

023:010 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath
        certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to
        destroy the city for my sake.

023:011 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
        come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I
        beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will
        come down.

023:012 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
        into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver
        thee up.

023:013 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose
        and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could
        go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah;
        and he forbare to go forth.

023:014 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and
        remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul
        sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

023:015 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and
        David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

023:016 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the
        wood, and strengthened his hand in God.

023:017 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
        shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I
        shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

023:018 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode
        in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

023:019 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
        David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the
        hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?

023:020 Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire
        of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him
        into the king's hand.

023:021 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have
        compassion on me.

023:022 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where
        his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me
        that he dealeth very subtilly.

023:023 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
        where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the
        certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass,
        if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout
        all the thousands of Judah.

023:024 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and
        his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the
        south of Jeshimon.

023:025 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
        wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the
        wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after
        David in the wilderness of Maon.

023:026 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
        men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get
        away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David
        and his men round about to take them.

023:027 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
        come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

023:028 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
        against the Philistines: therefore they called that place
        Selahammahlekoth.

023:029 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
        Engedi.

024:001 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
        Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in
        the wilderness of Engedi.

024:002 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
        and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild
        goats.

024:003 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave;
        and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men
        remained in the sides of the cave.

024:004 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which
        the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy
        into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem
        good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of
        Saul's robe privily.

024:005 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him,
        because he had cut off Saul's skirt.

024:006 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do
        this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch
        forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the
        LORD.

024:007 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered
        them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the
        cave, and went on his way.

024:008 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and
        cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul
        looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth,
        and bowed himself.

024:009 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words,
        saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

024:010 Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had
        delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some
        bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I
        will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the
        LORD's anointed.

024:011 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
        hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed
        thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor
        transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against
        thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.

024:012 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
        thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

024:013 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth
        from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

024:014 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost
        thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

024:015 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee,
        and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

024:016 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
        these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my
        son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

024:017 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
        hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

024:018 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well
        with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into
        thine hand, thou killedst me not.

024:019 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
        wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done
        unto me this day.

024:020 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king,
        and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine
        hand.

024:021 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not
        cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my
        name out of my father's house.

024:022 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and
        his men gat them up unto the hold.

025:001 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered
        together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at
        Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of
        Paran.

025:002 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
        and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep,
        and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

025:003 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
        Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a
        beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in
        his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.

025:004 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
        sheep.

025:005 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the
        young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet
        him in my name:

025:006 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace
        be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be
        unto all that thou hast.

025:007 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy
        shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was
        there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in
        Carmel.

025:008 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
        young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good
        day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto
        thy servants, and to thy son David.

025:009 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according
        to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.

025:010 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?
        and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days
        that break away every man from his master.

025:011 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I
        have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know
        not whence they be?

025:012 So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and
        came and told him all those sayings.

025:013 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword.
        And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded
        on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred
        men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.

025:014 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying,
        Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute
        our master; and he railed on them.

025:015 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
        neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant
        with them, when we were in the fields:

025:016 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while
        we were with them keeping the sheep.

025:017 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
        determined against our master, and against all his household:
        for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to
        him.

025:018 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
        bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
        measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins,
        and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.

025:019 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I
        come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

025:020 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by
        the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came
        down against her; and she met them.

025:021 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
        fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of
        all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for
        good.

025:022 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave
        of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that
        pisseth against the wall.

025:023 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the
        ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to
        the ground,

025:024 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
        this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
        in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

025:025 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
        Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and
        folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men
        of my lord, whom thou didst send.

025:026 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
        liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to
        shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now
        let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as
        Nabal.

025:027 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto
        my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow
        my lord.

025:028 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
        LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord
        fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found
        in thee all thy days.

025:029 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but
        the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with
        the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall
        he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.

025:030 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my
        lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning
        thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;

025:031 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart
        unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or
        that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall
        have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.

025:032 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
        which sent thee this day to meet me:

025:033 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast
        kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging
        myself with mine own hand.

025:034 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath
        kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and
        come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by
        the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

025:035 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,
        and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have
        hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.

025:036 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
        house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry
        within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him
        nothing, less or more, until the morning light.

025:037 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
        of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his
        heart died within him, and he became as a stone.

025:038 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote
        Nabal, that he died.

025:039 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
        the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the
        hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the
        LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head.
        And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him
        to wife.

025:040 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
        they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take
        thee to him to wife.

025:041 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
        said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet
        of the servants of my lord.

025:042 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
        damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the
        messengers of David, and became his wife.

025:043 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
        them his wives.

025:044 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to
        Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

026:001 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
        David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
        Jeshimon?

026:002 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
        having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek
        David in the wilderness of Ziph.

026:003 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
        Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and
        he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

026:004 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
        come in very deed.

026:005 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
        and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son
        of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench,
        and the people pitched round about him.

026:006 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
        Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will
        go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will
        go down with thee.

026:007 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
        Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in
        the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round
        about him.

026:008 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy
        into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I
        pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I
        will not smite him the second time.

026:009 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can
        stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be
        guiltless?

026:010 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall
        smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend
        into battle, and perish.

026:011 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
        the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear
        that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

026:012 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's
        bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew
        it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep
        sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.

026:013 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top
        of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:

026:014 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
        saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and
        said, Who art thou that criest to the king?

026:015 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who
        is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept
        thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to
        destroy the king thy lord.

026:016 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD
        liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your
        master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's
        spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.

026:017 And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my
        son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

026:018 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
        servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?

026:019 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the
        words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against
        me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of
        men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me
        out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD,
        saying, Go, serve other gods.

026:020 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
        face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a
        flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

026:021 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I
        will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in
        thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have
        erred exceedingly.

026:022 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let
        one of the young men come over and fetch it.

026:023 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
        faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day,
        but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's
        anointed.

026:024 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine
        eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD,
        and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.

026:025 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou
        shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So
        David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

027:001 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
        hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I
        should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and
        Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of
        Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.

027:002 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men
        that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of
        Gath.

027:003 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
        with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the
        Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

027:004 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he
        sought no more again for him.

027:005 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
        eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country,
        that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in
        the royal city with thee?

027:006 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag
        pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

027:007 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the
        Philistines was a full year and four months.

027:008 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
        the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of
        old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even
        unto the land of Egypt.

027:009 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman
        alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses,
        and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to
        Achish.

027:010 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
        said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the
        Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.

027:011 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings
        to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did
        David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in
        the country of the Philistines.

027:012 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
        Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant
        for ever.

028:001 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines
        gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with
        Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that
        thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.

028:002 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy
        servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I
        make thee keeper of mine head for ever.

028:003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and
        buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put
        away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of
        the land.

028:004 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
        pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and
        they pitched in Gilboa.

028:005 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,
        and his heart greatly trembled.

028:006 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
        neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

028:007 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
        familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And
        his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a
        familiar spirit at Endor.

028:008 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
        went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by
        night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the
        familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto
        thee.

028:009 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul
        hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar
        spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then
        layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?

028:010 And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth,
        there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
        said, Bring me up Samuel.

028:012 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice:
        and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived
        me? for thou art Saul.

028:013 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest
        thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out
        of the earth.

028:014 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
        man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul
        perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to
        the ground, and bowed himself.

028:015 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
        me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the
        Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me,
        and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
        therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto
        me what I shall do.

028:016 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing
        the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

028:017 And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD
        hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy
        neighbour, even to David:

028:018 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor
        executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the
        LORD done this thing unto thee this day.

028:019 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the
        hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons
        be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel
        into the hand of the Philistines.

028:020 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was
        sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no
        strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor
        all the night.

028:021 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore
        troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath
        obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have
        hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.

028:022 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice
        of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before
        thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest
        on thy way.

028:023 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
        together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto
        their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

028:024 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
        killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake
        unleavened bread thereof:

028:025 And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and
        they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

029:001 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to
        Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in
        Jezreel.

029:002 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
        thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward
        with Achish.

029:003 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these
        Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the
        Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king
        of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years,
        and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto
        this day?

029:004 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and
        the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow
        return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast
        appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest
        in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should
        he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with
        the heads of these men?

029:005 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
        saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

029:006 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the
        LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy
        coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have
        not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me
        unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.

029:007 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not
        the lords of the Philistines.

029:008 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what
        hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with
        thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the
        enemies of my lord the king?

029:009 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art
        good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the
        princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with
        us to the battle.

029:010 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's
        servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up
        early in the morning, and have light, depart.

029:011 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning,
        to return into the land of the Philistines. And the
        Philistines went up to Jezreel.

030:001 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to
        Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the
        south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with
        fire;

030:002 And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew
        not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and
        went on their way.

030:003 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was
        burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their
        daughters, were taken captives.

030:004 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their
        voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

030:005 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
        Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

030:006 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of
        stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved,
        every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David
        encouraged himself in the LORD his God.

030:007 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray
        thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither
        the ephod to David.

030:008 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after
        this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him,
        Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail
        recover all.

030:009 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him,
        and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind
        stayed.

030:010 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
        abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over
        the brook Besor.

030:011 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
        David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him
        drink water;

030:012 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters
        of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to
        him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three
        days and three nights.

030:013 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence
        art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to
        an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone
        I fell sick.

030:014 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and
        upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of
        Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

030:015 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this
        company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt
        neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master,
        and I will bring thee down to this company.

030:016 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
        abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing,
        because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the
        land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

030:017 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening
        of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save
        four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

030:018 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
        and David rescued his two wives.

030:019 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor
        great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any
        thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.

030:020 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
        before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

030:021 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint
        that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to
        abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David,
        and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came
        near to the people, he saluted them.

030:022 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those
        that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us,
        we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have
        recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that
        they may lead them away, and depart.

030:023 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
        which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and
        delivered the company that came against us into our hand.

030:024 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part
        is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that
        tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.

030:025 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
        and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

030:026 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
        elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present
        for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;

030:027 To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south
        Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,

030:028 And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in
        Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,

030:029 And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in
        the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the
        cities of the Kenites,

030:030 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
        Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,

030:031 And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where
        David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

031:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of
        Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
        in mount Gilboa.

031:002 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
        and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
        Melchishua, Saul's sons.

031:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
        him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.

031:004 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and
        thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and
        thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would
        not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and
        fell upon it.

031:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
        likewise upon his sword, and died with him.

031:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and
        all his men, that same day together.

031:007 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
        valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that
        the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
        they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came
        and dwelt in them.

031:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
        to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons
        fallen in mount Gilboa.

031:009 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and
        sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish
        it in the house of their idols, and among the people.

031:010 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
        fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.

031:011 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which
        the Philistines had done to Saul;

031:012 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
        body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of
        Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.

031:013 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
        Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

Book 10	2 Samuel

001:001 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
        returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
        abode two days in Ziklag;

001:002 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man
        came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and
        earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David,
        that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

001:003 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
        unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

001:004 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,
        tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the
        battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and
        Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

001:005 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest
        thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

001:006 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
        upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and,
        lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

001:007 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.
        And I answered, Here am I.

001:008 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
        Amalekite.

001:009 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay
        me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole
        in me.

001:010 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
        could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown
        that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,
        and have brought them hither unto my lord.

001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and
        likewise all the men that were with him:

001:012 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
        and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and
        for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the
        sword.

001:013 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art
        thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an
        Amalekite.

001:014 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
        forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?

001:015 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and
        fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

001:016 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
        mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the
        LORD's anointed.

001:017 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
        Jonathan his son:

001:018 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the
        bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

001:019 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are
        the mighty fallen!

001:020 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;
        lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the
        daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

001:021 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there
        be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the
        shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,
        as though he had not been anointed with oil.

001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the
        bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul
        returned not empty.

001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and
        in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than
        eagles, they were stronger than lions.

001:024 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
        scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold
        upon your apparel.

001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O
        Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.

001:026 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant
        hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing
        the love of women.

001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

002:001 And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the
        LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?
        And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither
        shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.

002:002 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
        Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

002:003 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man
        with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

002:004 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
        over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the
        men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

002:005 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and
        said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed
        this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried
        him.

002:006 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also
        will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this
        thing.

002:007 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye
        valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of
        Judah have anointed me king over them.

002:008 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took
        Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;

002:009 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and
        over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over
        all Israel.

002:010 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to
        reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of
        Judah followed David.

002:011 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
        Judah was seven years and six months.

002:012 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the
        son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

002:013 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went
        out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat
        down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on
        the other side of the pool.

002:014 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
        before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

002:015 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
        which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of
        the servants of David.

002:016 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust
        his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:
        wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in
        Gibeon.

002:017 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was
        beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

002:018 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
        and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

002:019 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to
        the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And
        he answered, I am.

002:021 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
        thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take
        thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from
        following of him.

002:022 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
        me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then
        should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?

002:023 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the
        hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that
        the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and
        died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as
        came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

002:024 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went
        down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth
        before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

002:025 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
        after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an
        hill.

002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour
        for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the
        latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people
        return from following their brethren?

002:027 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely
        then in the morning the people had gone up every one from
        following his brother.

002:028 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
        pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

002:029 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
        and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they
        came to Mahanaim.

002:030 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had
        gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's
        servants nineteen men and Asahel.

002:031 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of
        Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

002:032 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of
        his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went
        all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
        of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house
        of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.

003:002 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was
        Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

003:003 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the
        Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the
        daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;

003:004 And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
        Shephatiah the son of Abital;

003:005 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born
        to David in Hebron.

003:006 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of
        Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong
        for the house of Saul.

003:007 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter
        of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou
        gone in unto my father's concubine?

003:008 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and
        said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness
        this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,
        and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand
        of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning
        this woman?

003:009 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath
        sworn to David, even so I do to him;

003:010 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up
        the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even
        to Beersheba.

003:011 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
        him.

003:012 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,
        Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and,
        behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel
        unto thee.

003:013 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one
        thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,
        except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou
        comest to see my face.

003:014 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,
        Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an
        hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

003:015 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
        Phaltiel the son of Laish.

003:016 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
        Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he
        returned.

003:017 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
        Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:

003:018 Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By
        the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out
        of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all
        their enemies.

003:019 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went
        also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed
        good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of
        Benjamin.

003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
        David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

003:021 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will
        gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a
        league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that
        thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went
        in peace.

003:022 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing
        a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was
        not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was
        gone in peace.

003:023 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they
        told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and
        he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.

003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
        behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent
        him away, and he is quite gone?

003:025 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive
        thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know
        all that thou doest.

003:026 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
        after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah:
        but David knew it not.

003:027 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in
        the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under
        the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his
        brother.

003:028 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
        are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner
        the son of Ner:

003:029 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's
        house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that
        hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff,
        or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.

003:030 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had
        slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

003:031 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with
        him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
        before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.

003:032 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
        voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people
        wept.

003:033 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a
        fool dieth?

003:034 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a
        man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the
        people wept again over him.

003:035 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while
        it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more
        also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

003:036 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
        whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

003:037 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
        was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

003:038 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is
        a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?

003:039 And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
        the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward
        the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

004:001 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his
        hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

004:002 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the
        name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,
        the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin:
        (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.

004:003 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there
        until this day.)

004:004 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.
        He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and
        Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled:
        and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,
        and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

004:005 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,
        went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of
        Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.

004:006 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though
        they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the
        fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

004:007 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
        bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded
        him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain
        all night.

004:008 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron,
        and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of
        Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath
        avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

004:009 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
        Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth,
        who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,

004:010 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to
        have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in
        Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for
        his tidings:

004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
        in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now
        require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the
        earth?

004:012 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut
        off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the
        pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and
        buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
        spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

005:002 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he
        that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said
        to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a
        captain over Israel.

005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and
        king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD:
        and they anointed David king over Israel.

005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned forty years.

005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:
        and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all
        Israel and Judah.

005:006 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,
        the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying,
        Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not
        come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.

005:007 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is
        the city of David.

005:008 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the
        gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind
        that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.
        Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come
        into the house.

005:009 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.
        And David built round about from Millo and inward.

005:010 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts
        was with him.

005:011 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar
        trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an
        house.

005:012 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king
        over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his
        people Israel's sake.

005:013 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
        after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and
        daughters born to David.

005:014 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
        Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

005:015 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

005:016 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

005:017 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David
        king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David;
        and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.

005:018 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley
        of Rephaim.

005:019 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
        Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the
        LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the
        Philistines into thine hand.

005:020 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
        said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me,
        as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that
        place Baalperazim.

005:021 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
        them.

005:022 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
        in the valley of Rephaim.

005:023 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not
        go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them
        over against the mulberry trees.

005:024 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the
        tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir
        thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite
        the host of the Philistines.

005:025 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
        Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

006:001 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
        thirty thousand.

006:002 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with
        him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of
        God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts
        that dwelleth between the cherubims.

006:003 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it
        out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and
        Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

006:004 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
        Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the
        ark.

006:005 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD
        on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps,
        and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on
        cymbals.

006:006 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth
        his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen
        shook it.

006:007 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God
        smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of
        God.

006:008 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
        upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to
        this day.

006:009 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall
        the ark of the LORD come to me?

006:010 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into
        the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house
        of Obededom the Gittite.

006:011 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
        Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all
        his household.

006:012 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the
        house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because
        of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God
        from the house of Obededom into the city of David with
        gladness.

006:013 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD
        had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

006:014 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
        was girded with a linen ephod.

006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
        LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

006:016 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal
        Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David
        leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in
        her heart.

006:017 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his
        place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched
        for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
        before the LORD.

006:018 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt
        offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
        name of the LORD of hosts.

006:019 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole
        multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one
        a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of
        wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.

006:020 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
        daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How
        glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself
        to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of
        the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!

006:021 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which
        chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to
        appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:
        therefore will I play before the LORD.

006:022 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in
        mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken
        of, of them shall I be had in honour.

006:023 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the
        day of her death.

007:001 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the
        LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;

007:002 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
        in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within
        curtains.

007:003 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine
        heart; for the LORD is with thee.

007:004 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
        unto Nathan, saying,

007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou
        build me an house for me to dwell in?

007:006 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I
        brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this
        day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

007:007 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children
        of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
        whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build
        ye not me an house of cedar?

007:008 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
        saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from
        following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:

007:009 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut
        off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a
        great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in
        the earth.

007:010 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
        plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and
        move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict
        them any more, as beforetime,

007:011 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
        people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine
        enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an
        house.

007:012 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
        fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall
        proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

007:013 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
        throne of his kingdom for ever.

007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
        iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the
        stripes of the children of men:

007:015 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from
        Saul, whom I put away before thee.

007:016 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
        before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this
        vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

007:018 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
        Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast
        brought me hitherto?

007:019 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but
        thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while
        to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

007:020 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,
        knowest thy servant.

007:021 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast
        thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know
        them.

007:022 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
        thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all
        that we have heard with our ears.

007:023 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
        Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and
        to make him a name, and to do for you great things and
        terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou
        redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their
        gods?

007:024 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a
        people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their
        God.

007:025 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
        thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever,
        and do as thou hast said.

007:026 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of
        hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant
        David be established before thee.

007:027 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
        servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath
        thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

007:028 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
        and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

007:029 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy
        servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou,
        O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the
        house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

008:001 And after this it came to pass that David smote the
        Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out
        of the hand of the Philistines.

008:002 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
        down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to
        death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the
        Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.

008:003 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
        as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

008:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
        horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all
        the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred
        chariots.

008:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer
        king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty
        thousand men.

008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
        became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD
        preserved David whithersoever he went.

008:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
        of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

008:008 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king
        David took exceeding much brass.

008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the
        host of Hadadezer,

008:010 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him,
        and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and
        smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram
        brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and
        vessels of brass:

008:011 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the
        silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he
        subdued;

008:012 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
        the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,
        son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

008:013 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
        Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

008:014 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
        garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And
        the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

008:015 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
        and justice unto all his people.

008:016 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud was recorder;

008:017 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of
        Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

008:018 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

009:001 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of
        Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

009:002 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was
        Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said
        unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.

009:003 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul,
        that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said
        unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his
        feet.

009:004 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto
        the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of
        Ammiel, in Lodebar.

009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of
        Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

009:006 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
        was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.
        And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy
        servant!

009:007 And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee
        kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee
        all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at
        my table continually.

009:008 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
        shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?

009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto
        him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to
        Saul and to all his house.

009:010 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the
        land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy
        master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy
        master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had
        fifteen sons and twenty servants.

009:011 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord
        the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.
        As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table,
        as one of the king's sons.

009:012 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And
        all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto
        Mephibosheth.

009:013 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually
        at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

010:001 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children
        of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

010:002 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
        Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent
        to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And
        David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

010:003 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
        lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he
        hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his
        servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and
        to overthrow it?

010:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one
        half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the
        middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

010:005 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because
        the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at
        Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

010:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before
        David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of
        Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen,
        and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve
        thousand men.

010:007 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
        the mighty men.

010:008 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
        array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba,
        and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in
        the field.

010:009 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him
        before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,
        and put them in array against the Syrians:

010:010 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of
        Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against
        the children of Ammon.

010:011 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
        shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
        thee, then I will come and help thee.

010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people,
        and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which
        seemeth him good.

010:013 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto
        the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

010:014 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
        then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.
        So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to
        Jerusalem.

010:015 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
        they gathered themselves together.

010:016 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were
        beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the
        captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

010:017 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together,
        and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set
        themselves in array against David, and fought with him.

010:018 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of
        seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand
        horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who
        died there.

010:019 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw
        that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with
        Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the
        children of Ammon any more.

011:001 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time
        when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his
        servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the
        children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried
        still at Jerusalem.

011:002 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from
        off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and
        from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman
        was very beautiful to look upon.

011:003 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is
        not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah
        the Hittite?

011:004 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
        him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her
        uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.

011:005 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I
        am with child.

011:006 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
        Joab sent Uriah to David.

011:007 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how
        Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

011:008 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy
        feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there
        followed him a mess of meat from the king.

011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the
        servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

011:010 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto
        his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy
        journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?

011:011 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
        abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
        are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine
        house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou
        livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.

011:012 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow
        I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,
        and the morrow.

011:013 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before
        him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on
        his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to
        his house.

011:014 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter
        to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

011:015 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
        forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that
        he may be smitten, and die.

011:016 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
        assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men
        were.

011:017 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
        there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and
        Uriah the Hittite died also.

011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the
        war;

011:019 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end
        of telling the matters of the war unto the king,

011:020 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto
        thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye
        did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?

011:021 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman
        cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he
        died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy
        servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab
        had sent him for.

011:023 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
        against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were
        upon them even unto the entering of the gate.

011:024 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
        some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the
        Hittite is dead also.

011:025 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
        Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword
        devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong
        against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

011:026 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
        dead, she mourned for her husband.

011:027 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to
        his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But
        the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

012:001 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
        said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich,
        and the other poor.

012:002 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:

012:003 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which
        he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with
        him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and
        drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him
        as a daughter.

012:004 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
        take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the
        wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's
        lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.

012:005 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
        said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done
        this thing shall surely die:

012:006 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
        thing, and because he had no pity.

012:007 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the
        LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I
        delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;

012:008 And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives
        into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of
        Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have
        given unto thee such and such things.

012:009 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to
        do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with
        the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast
        slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.

012:010 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
        because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of
        Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

012:011 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
        out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
        eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with
        thy wives in the sight of this sun.

012:012 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before
        all Israel, and before the sun.

012:013 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.
        And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy
        sin; thou shalt not die.

012:014 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion
        to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that
        is born unto thee shall surely die.

012:015 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
        child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

012:016 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
        and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

012:017 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise
        him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat
        bread with them.

012:018 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.
        And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child
        was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet
        alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our
        voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
        child is dead?

012:019 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David
        perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto
        his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
        himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of
        the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and
        when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.

012:021 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
        hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it
        was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and
        eat bread.

012:022 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
        for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me,
        that the child may live?

012:023 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him
        back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

012:024 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
        and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name
        Solomon: and the LORD loved him.

012:025 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called
        his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.

012:026 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
        took the royal city.

012:027 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
        against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and
        encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city,
        and it be called after my name.

012:029 And David gathered all the people together, and went to
        Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

012:030 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight
        whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it
        was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the
        city in great abundance.

012:031 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put
        them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of
        iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did
        he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and
        all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

013:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David
        had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of
        David loved her.

013:002 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister
        Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him
        to do anything to her.

013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
        Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

013:004 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean
        from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto
        him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

013:005 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
        thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto
        him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat,
        and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it
        at her hand.

013:006 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king
        was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee,
        let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my
        sight, that I may eat at her hand.

013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
        Amnon's house, and dress him meat.

013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid
        down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in
        his sight, and did bake the cakes.

013:009 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he
        refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And
        they went out every man from him.

013:010 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber,
        that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which
        she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her
        brother.

013:011 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
        her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

013:012 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no
        such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

013:013 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
        thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I
        pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me
        from thee.

013:014 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being
        stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.

013:015 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
        he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved
        her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

013:016 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending
        me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But
        he would not hearken unto her.

013:017 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
        Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

013:018 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with
        such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins
        apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the
        door after her.

013:019 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of
        divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head,
        and went on crying.

013:020 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
        been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy
        brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in
        her brother Absalom's house.

013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
        wroth.

013:022 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
        for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister
        Tamar.

013:023 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
        sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and
        Absalom invited all the king's sons.

013:024 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy
        servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and
        his servants go with thy servant.

013:025 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
        go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him:
        howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.

013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon
        go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with
        thee?

013:027 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's
        sons go with him.

013:028 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now
        when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto
        you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I
        commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.

013:029 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
        commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat
        him up upon his mule, and fled.

013:030 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
        came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons,
        and there is not one of them left.

013:031 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
        earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

013:032 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and
        said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the
        young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the
        appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day
        that he forced his sister Tamar.

013:033 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
        heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon
        only is dead.

013:034 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
        up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people
        by the way of the hill side behind him.

013:035 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come:
        as thy servant said, so it is.

013:036 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of
        speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up
        their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants
        wept very sore.

013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
        of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three
        years.

013:039 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom:
        for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
        was toward Absalom.

014:002 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
        said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and
        put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil,
        but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:

014:003 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So
        Joab put the words in her mouth.

014:004 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on
        her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O
        king.

014:005 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
        answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

014:006 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in
        the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote
        the other, and slew him.

014:007 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
        and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may
        kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we
        will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal
        which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name
        nor remainder upon the earth.

014:008 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I
        will give charge concerning thee.

014:009 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king,
        the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king
        and his throne be guiltless.

014:010 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
        me, and he shall not touch thee any more.

014:011 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
        God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to
        destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As
        the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to
        the earth.

014:012 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
        one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

014:013 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
        thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this
        thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch
        home again his banished.

014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,
        which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect
        any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not
        expelled from him.

014:015 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my
        lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:
        and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may
        be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.

014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the
        hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out
        of the inheritance of God.

014:017 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall
        now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the
        king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will
        be with thee.

014:018 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
        me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the
        woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.

014:019 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
        this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my
        lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left
        from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant
        Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of
        thine handmaid:

014:020 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done
        this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an
        angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.

014:021 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this
        thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

014:022 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself,
        and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant
        knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king,
        in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.

014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
        Jerusalem.

014:024 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him
        not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw
        not the king's face.

014:025 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
        Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the
        crown of his head there was no blemish in him.

014:026 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end
        that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him,
        therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at
        two hundred shekels after the king's weight.

014:027 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
        whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

014:028 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
        king's face.

014:029 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
        but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the
        second time, he would not come.

014:030 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near
        mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And
        Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said
        unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?

014:032 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,
        Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say,
        Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to
        have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's
        face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.

014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called
        for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his
        face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed
        Absalom.

015:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
        chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

015:002 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the
        gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy
        came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him,
        and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is
        of one of the tribes of Israel.

015:003 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and
        right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
        that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto
        me, and I would do him justice!

015:005 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him
        obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed
        him.

015:006 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
        king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of
        Israel.

015:007 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto
        the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have
        vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.

015:008 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
        saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
        then I will serve the LORD.

015:009 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went
        to Hebron.

015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
        saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye
        shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

015:011 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
        were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew
        not any thing.

015:012 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's
        counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered
        sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people
        increased continually with Absalom.

015:013 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
        men of Israel are after Absalom.

015:014 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
        Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else
        escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us
        suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the
        edge of the sword.

015:015 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy
        servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall
        appoint.

015:016 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
        the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the
        house.

015:017 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
        tarried in a place that was far off.

015:018 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
        Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six
        hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before
        the king.

015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
        also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king:
        for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.

015:020 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
        go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return
        thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with
        thee.

015:021 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
        as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the
        king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will
        thy servant be.

015:022 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the
        Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones
        that were with him.

015:023 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
        passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook
        Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the
        wilderness.

015:024 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
        the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of
        God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done
        passing out of the city.

015:025 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into
        the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he
        will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:

015:026 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am
        I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

015:027 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
        return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
        Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

015:028 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
        come word from you to certify me.

015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
        Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

015:030 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as
        he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot:
        and all the people that was with him covered every man his
        head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

015:031 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the
        conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray
        thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.

015:032 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of
        the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite
        came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:

015:033 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou
        shalt be a burden unto me:

015:034 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will
        be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant
        hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou
        for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

015:035 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
        priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou
        shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to
        Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
        Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall
        send unto me every thing that ye can hear.

015:037 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came
        into Jerusalem.

016:001 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
        Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of
        asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and
        an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer
        fruits, and a bottle of wine.

016:002 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And
        Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on;
        and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and
        the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.

016:003 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba
        said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he
        said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom
        of my father.

016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that
        pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech
        thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

016:005 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a
        man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei,
        the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

016:006 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
        David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his
        right hand and on his left.

016:007 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
        bloody man, and thou man of Belial:

016:008 The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of
        Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath
        delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,
        behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a
        bloody man.

016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
        this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray
        thee, and take off his head.

016:010 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
        Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto
        him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done
        so?

016:011 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my
        son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much
        more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him
        curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.

016:012 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
        the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

016:013 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
        the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and
        threw stones at him, and cast dust.

016:014 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came
        weary, and refreshed themselves there.

016:015 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
        Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

016:016 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend,
        was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save
        the king, God save the king.

016:017 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy
        friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?

016:018 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this
        people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and
        with him will I abide.

016:019 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
        presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's
        presence, so will I be in thy presence.

016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what
        we shall do.

016:021 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
        concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all
        Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then
        shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
        Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of
        all Israel.

016:023 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
        days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so
        was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with
        Absalom.

017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
        twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David
        this night:

017:002 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed,
        and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him
        shall flee; and I will smite the king only:

017:003 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom
        thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be
        in peace.

017:004 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
        Israel.

017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
        us hear likewise what he saith.

017:006 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
        saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do
        after his saying? if not; speak thou.

017:007 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
        given is not good at this time.

017:008 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that
        they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a
        bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a
        man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and
        it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the
        first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a
        slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.

017:010 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a
        lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy
        father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant
        men.

017:011 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
        thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the
        sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own
        person.

017:012 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be
        found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the
        ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there
        shall not be left so much as one.

017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
        bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,
        until there be not one small stone found there.

017:014 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
        Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
        For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of
        Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon
        Absalom.

017:015 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
        and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of
        Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.

017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not
        this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass
        over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that
        are with him.

017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
        be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them;
        and they went and told king David.

017:018 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
        both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in
        Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went
        down.

017:019 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's
        mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not
        known.

017:020 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,
        they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said
        unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they
        had sought and could not find them, they returned to
        Jerusalem.

017:021 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came
        up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said
        unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus
        hath Ahithophel counselled against you.

017:022 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
        they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not
        one of them that was not gone over Jordan.

017:023 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
        saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to
        his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself,
        and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.

017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan,
        he and all the men of Israel with him.

017:025 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
        which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an
        Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,
        sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.

017:026 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

017:027 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that
        Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
        and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the
        Gileadite of Rogelim,

017:028 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
        barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles,
        and parched pulse,

017:029 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for
        David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they
        said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
        wilderness.

018:001 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
        captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.

018:002 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand
        of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of
        Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of
        Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will
        surely go forth with you myself also.

018:003 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we
        flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us
        die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten
        thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour
        us out of the city.

018:004 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.
        And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came
        out by hundreds and by thousands.

018:005 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
        Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
        And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains
        charge concerning Absalom.

018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
        battle was in the wood of Ephraim;

018:007 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of
        David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of
        twenty thousand men.

018:008 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
        country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the
        sword devoured.

018:009 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
        mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,
        and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up
        between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under
        him went away.

018:010 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I
        saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

018:011 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
        sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the
        ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and
        a girdle.

018:012 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
        shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine
        hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king
        charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
        touch the young man Absalom.

018:013 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own
        life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou
        thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.

018:014 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
        three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
        Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

018:015 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and
        smote Absalom, and slew him.

018:016 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from
        pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

018:017 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
        wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all
        Israel fled every one to his tent.

018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for
        himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I
        have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the
        pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day,
        Absalom's place.

018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
        the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his
        enemies.

018:020 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
        but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou
        shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

018:021 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
        And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
        howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab
        said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast
        no tidings ready?

018:023 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run.
        Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

018:024 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up
        to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his
        eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.

018:025 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said,
        If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came
        apace, and drew near.

018:026 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
        called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running
        alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

018:027 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
        is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king
        said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

018:028 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And
        he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and
        said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the
        men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

018:029 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
        answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy
        servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

018:030 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
        turned aside, and stood still.

018:031 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
        king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that
        rose up against thee.

018:032 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?
        And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all
        that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man
        is.

018:033 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over
        the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son
        Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for
        thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

019:001 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth
        for Absalom.

019:002 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
        people: for the people heard say that day how the king was
        grieved for his son.

019:003 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
        people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

019:004 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
        voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

019:005 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast
        shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day
        have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy
        daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy
        concubines;

019:006 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For
        thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither
        princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom
        had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased
        thee well.

019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
        servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there
        will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be
        worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy
        youth until now.

019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto
        all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.
        And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled
        every man to his tent.

019:009 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
        Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our
        enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the
        Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.

019:010 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
        therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?

019:011 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
        saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the
        last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of
        all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.

019:012 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore
        then are ye the last to bring back the king?

019:013 And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?
        God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the
        host before me continually in the room of Joab.

019:014 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
        heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king,
        Return thou, and all thy servants.

019:015 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
        Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over
        Jordan.

019:016 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
        hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

019:017 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
        the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
        twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the
        king.

019:018 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
        household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son
        of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

019:019 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto
        me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did
        perversely the day that my lord the king went out of
        Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

019:020 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,
        behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of
        Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.

019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
        Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's
        anointed?

019:022 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
        Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall
        there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I
        know that I am this day king over Israel?

019:023 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And
        the king sware unto him.

019:024 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,
        and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor
        washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the
        day he came again in peace.

019:025 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
        king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou
        with me, Mephibosheth?

019:026 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for
        thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride
        thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.

019:027 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but
        my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is
        good in thine eyes.

019:028 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord
        the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did
        eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry
        any more unto the king?

019:029 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy
        matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

019:030 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
        forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his
        own house.

019:031 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
        over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old:
        and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at
        Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.

019:033 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and
        I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

019:034 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live,
        that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?

019:035 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between
        good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I
        drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and
        singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a
        burden unto my lord the king?

019:036 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:
        and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?

019:037 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die
        in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and
        of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over
        with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto
        thee.

019:038 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I
        will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and
        whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.

019:039 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was
        come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he
        returned unto his own place.

019:040 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:
        and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half
        the people of Israel.

019:041 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said
        unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen
        thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and
        all David's men with him, over Jordan?

019:042 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because
        the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for
        this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath
        he given us any gift?

019:043 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We
        have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in
        David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice
        should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the
        words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the
        men of Israel.

020:001 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
        Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet,
        and said, We have no part in David, neither have we
        inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O
        Israel.

020:002 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed
        Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their
        king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.

020:003 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took
        the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the
        house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in
        unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death,
        living in widowhood.

020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah
        within three days, and be thou here present.

020:005 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried
        longer than the set time which he had appointed him.

020:006 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri
        do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's
        servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities,
        and escape us.

020:007 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites,
        and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out
        of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa
        went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was
        girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened
        upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it
        fell out.

020:009 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And
        Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
        so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his
        bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.
        So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of
        Bichri.

020:011 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that
        favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after
        Joab.

020:012 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
        when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed
        Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon
        him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.

020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on
        after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

020:014 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
        Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered
        together, and went also after him.

020:015 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and
        they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the
        trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the
        wall, to throw it down.

020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I
        pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with
        thee.

020:017 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou
        Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear
        the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

020:018 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
        saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they
        ended the matter.

020:019 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
        thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why
        wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?

020:020 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that
        I should swallow up or destroy.

020:021 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the
        son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the
        king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart
        from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head
        shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

020:022 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And
        they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it
        out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the
        city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem
        unto the king.

020:023 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son
        of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:

020:024 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of
        Ahilud was recorder:

020:025 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:

020:026 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

021:001 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
        after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD
        answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he
        slew the Gibeonites.

021:002 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now
        the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the
        remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn
        unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the
        children of Israel and Judah.)

021:003 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
        you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may
        bless the inheritance of the LORD?

021:004 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor
        gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill
        any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I
        do for you.

021:005 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
        devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining
        in any of the coasts of Israel,

021:006 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will
        hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD
        did choose. And the king said, I will give them.

021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
        of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them,
        between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.

021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
        whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five
        sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for
        Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:

021:009 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and
        they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell
        all seven together, and were put to death in the days of
        harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley
        harvest.

021:010 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
        for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until
        water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither
        the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of
        the field by night.

021:011 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
        concubine of Saul, had done.

021:012 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
        Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had
        stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines
        had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in
        Gilboa:

021:013 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones
        of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that
        were hanged.

021:014 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
        country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his
        father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And
        after that God was intreated for the land.

021:015 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
        David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against
        the Philistines: and David waxed faint.

021:016 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
        of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in
        weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have
        slain David.

021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
        Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto
        him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that
        thou quench not the light of Israel.

021:018 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
        with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite
        slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.

021:019 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,
        where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the
        brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was
        like a weaver's beam.

021:020 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
        stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot
        six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to
        the giant.

021:021 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
        brother of David slew him.

021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the
        hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

022:001 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the
        day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his
        enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:

022:002 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my
        deliverer;

022:003 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and
        the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my
        saviour; thou savest me from violence.

022:004 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall
        I be saved from mine enemies.

022:005 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly
        men made me afraid;

022:006 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death
        prevented me;

022:007 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God:
        and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did
        enter into his ears.

022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
        moved and shook, because he was wroth.

022:009 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
        mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was
        under his feet.

022:011 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon
        the wings of the wind.

022:012 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,
        and thick clouds of the skies.

022:013 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

022:014 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
        voice.

022:015 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
        discomfited them.

022:016 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
        world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the
        blast of the breath of his nostrils.

022:017 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;

022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
        me: for they were too strong for me.

022:019 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
        my stay.

022:020 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.

022:021 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according
        to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

022:022 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.

022:023 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes,
        I did not depart from them.

022:024 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
        iniquity.

022:025 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
        righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

022:026 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with
        the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

022:027 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
        froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

022:028 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are
        upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

022:029 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
        darkness.

022:030 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I
        leaped over a wall.

022:031 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
        he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.

022:032 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our
        God?

022:033 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

022:034 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my
        high places.

022:035 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken
        by mine arms.

022:036 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
        gentleness hath made me great.

022:037 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
        slip.

022:038 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned
        not again until I had consumed them.

022:039 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could
        not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

022:040 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that
        rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.

022:041 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I
        might destroy them that hate me.

022:042 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD,
        but he answered them not.

022:043 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
        stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them
        abroad.

022:044 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
        thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I
        knew not shall serve me.

022:045 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they
        hear, they shall be obedient unto me.

022:046 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of
        their close places.

022:047 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the
        God of the rock of my salvation.

022:048 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
        under me.

022:049 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
        lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou
        hast delivered me from the violent man.

022:050 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
        heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

022:051 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy
        to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

023:001 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
        said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of
        the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

023:002 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my
        tongue.

023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He
        that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

023:004 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun
        riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass
        springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.

023:005 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me
        an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for
        this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make
        it not to grow.

023:006 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
        away, because they cannot be taken with hands:

023:007 But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and
        the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with
        fire in the same place.

023:008 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The
        Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the
        same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight
        hundred, whom he slew at one time.

023:009 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of
        the three mighty men with David, when they defied the
        Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and
        the men of Israel were gone away:

023:010 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary,
        and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a
        great victory that day; and the people returned after him only
        to spoil.

023:011 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And
        the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was
        a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from
        the Philistines.

023:012 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
        slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.

023:013 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in
        the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of
        the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

023:014 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the
        Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

023:015 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
        the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!

023:016 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the
        Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that
        was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
        nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out
        unto the LORD.

023:017 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:
        is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of
        their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did
        these three mighty men.

023:018 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was
        chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three
        hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.

023:019 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
        captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

023:020 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
        Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of
        Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit
        in time of snow:

023:021 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
        spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and
        plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him
        with his own spear.

023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
        among three mighty men.

023:023 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to
        the first three. And David set him over his guard.

023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the
        son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

023:027 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,

023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of
        Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,

023:030 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,

023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,

023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,

023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,

023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,
        Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

023:035 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,

023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to
        Joab the son of Zeruiah,

023:038 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,

023:039 Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.

024:001 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,
        and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and
        Judah.

024:002 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was
        with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan
        even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know
        the number of the people.

024:003 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
        people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the
        eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the
        king delight in this thing?

024:004 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and
        against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of
        the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the
        people of Israel.

024:005 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the
        right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of
        Gad, and toward Jazer:

024:006 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and
        they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,

024:007 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of
        the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the
        south of Judah, even to Beersheba.

024:008 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
        Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

024:009 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
        king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant
        men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five
        hundred thousand men.

024:010 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the
        people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in
        that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away
        the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

024:011 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD
        came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

024:012 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three
        things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
        seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou
        flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue
        thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now
        advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent
        me.

024:014 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall
        now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and
        let me not fall into the hand of man.

024:015 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning
        even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from
        Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.

024:016 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
        destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the
        angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine
        hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of
        Araunah the Jebusite.

024:017 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
        the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done
        wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine
        hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's
        house.

024:018 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear
        an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the
        Jebusite.

024:019 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
        commanded.

024:020 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming
        on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before
        the king on his face upon the ground.

024:021 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
        servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to
        build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed
        from the people.

024:022 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and
        offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for
        burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other
        instruments of the oxen for wood.

024:023 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.
        And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.

024:024 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it
        of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto
        the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David
        bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
        silver.

024:025 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
        burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated
        for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

Book 11	1 Kings

001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
        him with clothes, but he gat no heat.

001:002 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for
        my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the
        king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom,
        that my lord the king may get heat.

001:003 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
        Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the
        king.

001:004 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and
        ministered to him: but the king knew her not.

001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I
        will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and
        fifty men to run before him.

001:006 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
        Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and
        his mother bare him after Absalom.

001:007 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with
        Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.

001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
        Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men
        which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.

001:009 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone
        of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren
        the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:

001:010 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and
        Solomon his brother, he called not.

001:011 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
        saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith
        doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?

001:012 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel,
        that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son
        Solomon.

001:013 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst
        not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying,
        Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
        sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?

001:014 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also
        will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.

001:015 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the
        king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto
        the king.

001:016 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
        king said, What wouldest thou?

001:017 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy
        God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son
        shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.

001:018 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
        thou knowest it not:

001:019 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance,
        and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the
        priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy
        servant hath he not called.

001:020 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon
        thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the
        throne of my lord the king after him.

001:021 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
        sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be
        counted offenders.

001:022 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
        prophet also came in.

001:023 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And
        when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
        the king with his face to the ground.

001:024 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah
        shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

001:025 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat
        cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's
        sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest;
        and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save
        king Adonijah.

001:026 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not
        called.

001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not
        shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my
        lord the king after him?

001:028 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she
        came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.

001:029 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
        redeemed my soul out of all distress,

001:030 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying,
        Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
        sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do
        this day.

001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did
        reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live
        for ever.

001:032 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
        prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before
        the king.

001:033 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of
        your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own
        mule, and bring him down to Gihon:

001:034 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
        there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say,
        God save king Solomon.

001:035 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon
        my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have
        appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

001:036 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
        Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.

001:037 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he
        with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of
        my lord king David.

001:038 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the
        son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went
        down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and
        brought him to Gihon.

001:039 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the
        tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet;
        and all the people said, God save king Solomon.

001:040 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped
        with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth
        rent with the sound of them.

001:041 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
        they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound
        of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city
        being in an uproar?

001:042 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
        the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou
        art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

001:043 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord
        king David hath made Solomon king.

001:044 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan
        the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
        Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to
        ride upon the king's mule:

001:045 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
        king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so
        that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have
        heard.

001:046 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

001:047 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king
        David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy
        name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the
        king bowed himself upon the bed.

001:048 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of
        Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day,
        mine eyes even seeing it.

001:049 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and
        rose up, and went every man his way.

001:050 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went,
        and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

001:051 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
        Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the
        altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he
        will not slay his servant with the sword.

001:052 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there
        shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness
        shall be found in him, he shall die.

001:053 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the
        altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and
        Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.

002:001 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he
        charged Solomon his son, saying,

002:002 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and
        shew thyself a man;

002:003 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways,
        to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,
        and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses,
        that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and
        whithersoever thou turnest thyself:

002:004 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning
        me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk
        before me in truth with all their heart and with all their
        soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne
        of Israel.

002:005 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to
        me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of
        Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of
        Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and
        put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins,
        and in his shoes that were on his feet.

002:006 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar
        head go down to the grave in peace.

002:007 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
        and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they
        came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.

002:008 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
        Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in
        the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me
        at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not
        put thee to death with the sword.

002:009 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man,
        and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar
        head bring thou down to the grave with blood.

002:010 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
        David.

002:011 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:
        seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
        reigned he in Jerusalem.

002:012 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
        kingdom was established greatly.

002:013 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother
        of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,
        Peaceably.

002:014 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she
        said, Say on.

002:015 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that
        all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit
        the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for
        it was his from the LORD.

002:016 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
        unto him, Say on.

002:017 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for
        he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the
        Shunammite to wife.

002:018 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.

002:019 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him
        for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed
        himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a
        seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right
        hand.

002:020 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray
        thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my
        mother: for I will not say thee nay.

002:021 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
        thy brother to wife.

002:022 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why
        dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him
        the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him,
        and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

002:023 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me,
        and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against
        his own life.

002:024 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me,
        and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made
        me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death
        this day.

002:025 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of
        Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.

002:026 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to
        Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death:
        but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou
        barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and
        because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was
        afflicted.

002:027 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the
        LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he
        spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

002:028 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
        though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the
        tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the
        altar.

002:029 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
        tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then
        Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall
        upon him.

002:030 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
        him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I
        will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again,
        saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.

002:031 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
        him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent
        blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my
        father.

002:032 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who
        fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew
        them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to
        wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and
        Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.

002:033 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
        upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon
        his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there
        be peace for ever from the LORD.

002:034 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
        slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the
        wilderness.

002:035 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over
        the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of
        Abiathar.

002:036 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
        Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not
        forth thence any whither.

002:037 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest
        over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou
        shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.

002:038 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord
        the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt
        in Jerusalem many days.

002:039 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
        servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of
        Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in
        Gath.

002:040 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to
        Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his
        servants from Gath.

002:041 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
        Gath, and was come again.

002:042 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
        Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto
        thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out,
        and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die?
        and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.

002:043 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
        commandment that I have charged thee with?

002:044 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the
        wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to
        David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy
        wickedness upon thine own head;

002:045 And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David
        shall be established before the LORD for ever.

002:046 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
        out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was
        established in the hand of Solomon.

003:001 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
        Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,
        until he had made an end of building his own house, and the
        house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

003:002 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was
        no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.

003:003 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David
        his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high
        places.

003:004 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
        the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon
        offer upon that altar.

003:005 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:
        and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.

003:006 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
        father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in
        truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with
        thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that
        thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this
        day.

003:007 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king
        instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I
        know not how to go out or come in.

003:008 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
        chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted
        for multitude.

003:009 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
        people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is
        able to judge this thy so great a people?

003:010 And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this
        thing.

003:011 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
        hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked
        riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies;
        but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;

003:012 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given
        thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none
        like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like
        unto thee.

003:013 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,
        both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among
        the kings like unto thee all thy days.

003:014 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
        commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will
        lengthen thy days.

003:015 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
        Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace
        offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.

003:016 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king,
        and stood before him.

003:017 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in
        one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the
        house.

003:018 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
        that this woman was delivered also: and we were together;
        there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the
        house.

003:019 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid
        it.

003:020 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
        while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid
        her dead child in my bosom.

003:021 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold,
        it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning,
        behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.

003:022 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and
        the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy
        son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the
        king.

003:023 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
        and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son
        is the dead, and my son is the living.

003:024 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
        before the king.

003:025 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
        half to the one, and half to the other.

003:026 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
        for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord,
        give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the
        other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.

003:027 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,
        and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.

003:028 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had
        judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom
        of God was in him, to do judgment.

004:001 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

004:002 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of
        Zadok the priest,

004:003 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud, the recorder.

004:004 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok
        and Abiathar were the priests:

004:005 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud
        the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's
        friend:

004:006 And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of
        Abda was over the tribute.

004:007 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which
        provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his
        month in a year made provision.

004:008 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:

004:009 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh,
        and Elonbethhanan:

004:010 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all
        the land of Hepher:

004:011 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had
        Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:

004:012 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
        and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from
        Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond
        Jokneam:

004:013 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns
        of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also
        pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore
        great cities with walls and brasen bars:

004:014 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:

004:015 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
        Solomon to wife:

004:016 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:

004:017 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:

004:018 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:

004:019 Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the
        country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of
        Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.

004:020 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
        multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.

004:021 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
        land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they
        brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

004:022 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of
        fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,

004:023 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an
        hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and
        fatted fowl.

004:024 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the
        river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this
        side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.

004:025 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine
        and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the
        days of Solomon.

004:026 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his
        chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

004:027 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for
        all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his
        month: they lacked nothing.

004:028 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought
        they unto the place where the officers were, every man
        according to his charge.

004:029 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
        and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea
        shore.

004:030 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
        of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

004:031 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
        Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame
        was in all nations round about.

004:032 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
        thousand and five.

004:033 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
        even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake
        also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of
        fishes.

004:034 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
        from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

005:001 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he
        had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
        father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.

005:002 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,

005:003 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house
        unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were
        about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the
        soles of his feet.

005:004 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so
        that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.

005:005 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the
        LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying,
        Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall
        build an house unto my name.

005:006 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
        Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto
        thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that
        thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among
        us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.

005:007 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
        that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this
        day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great
        people.

005:008 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the
        things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy
        desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of
        fir.

005:009 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea:
        and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that
        thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged
        there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish
        my desire, in giving food for my household.

005:010 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to
        all his desire.

005:011 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
        food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus
        gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.

005:012 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and
        there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a
        league together.

005:013 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
        was thirty thousand men.

005:014 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses:
        a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and
        Adoniram was over the levy.

005:015 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
        and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;

005:016 Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the
        work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the
        people that wrought in the work.

005:017 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
        stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

005:018 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and
        the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build
        the house.

006:001 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year
        after the children of Israel were come out of the land of
        Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in
        the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to
        build the house of the LORD.

006:002 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the
        length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof
        twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.

006:003 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits
        was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
        and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.

006:004 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.

006:005 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round
        about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the
        temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:

006:006 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle
        was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad:
        for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests
        round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the
        walls of the house.

006:007 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone
        made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was
        neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the
        house, while it was in building.

006:008 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
        house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle
        chamber, and out of the middle into the third.

006:009 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house
        with beams and boards of cedar.

006:010 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
        high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

006:011 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,

006:012 Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt
        walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my
        commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with
        thee, which I spake unto David thy father:

006:013 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not
        forsake my people Israel.

006:014 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

006:015 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of
        cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the
        ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and
        covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.

006:016 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
        floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them
        for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy
        place.

006:017 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
        long.

006:018 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and
        open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.

006:019 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there
        the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

006:020 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length,
        and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height
        thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the
        altar which was of cedar.

006:021 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he
        made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and
        he overlaid it with gold.

006:022 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had
        finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the
        oracle he overlaid with gold.

006:023 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree,
        each ten cubits high.

006:024 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five
        cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part
        of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten
        cubits.

006:025 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were
        of one measure and one size.

006:026 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of
        the other cherub.

006:027 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
        stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing
        of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other
        cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one
        another in the midst of the house.

006:028 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

006:029 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with
        carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers,
        within and without.

006:030 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
        without.

006:031 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive
        tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.

006:032 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
        carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and
        overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims,
        and upon the palm trees.

006:033 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive
        tree, a fourth part of the wall.

006:034 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
        door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were
        folding.

006:035 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open
        flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved
        work.

006:036 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone,
        and a row of cedar beams.

006:037 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
        laid, in the month Zif:

006:038 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the
        eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts
        thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he
        seven years in building it.

007:001 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
        finished all his house.

007:002 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length
        thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty
        cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows
        of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.

007:003 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay
        on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.

007:004 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against
        light in three ranks.

007:005 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and
        light was against light in three ranks.

007:006 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty
        cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch
        was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were
        before them.

007:007 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even
        the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one
        side of the floor to the other.

007:008 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the
        porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house
        for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto
        this porch.

007:009 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of
        hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from
        the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward
        the great court.

007:010 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
        stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

007:011 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed
        stones, and cedars.

007:012 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
        stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of
        the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.

007:013 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

007:014 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
        was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with
        wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in
        brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.

007:015 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high
        apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them
        about.

007:016 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the
        tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five
        cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:

007:017 And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the
        chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for
        the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.

007:018 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
        network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with
        pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.

007:019 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were
        of lily work in the porch, four cubits.

007:020 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
        above, over against the belly which was by the network: and
        the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the
        other chapiter.

007:021 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he
        set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin:
        and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof
        Boaz.

007:022 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work
        of the pillars finished.

007:023 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
        other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits:
        and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

007:024 And under the brim of it round about there were knops
        compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about:
        the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.

007:025 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
        three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
        south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
        above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

007:026 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
        wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it
        contained two thousand baths.

007:027 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of
        one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three
        cubits the height of it.

007:028 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had
        borders, and the borders were between the ledges:

007:029 And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions,
        oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base
        above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions
        made of thin work.

007:030 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass:
        and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver
        were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.

007:031 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:
        but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a
        cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings
        with their borders, foursquare, not round.

007:032 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of
        the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel
        was a cubit and half a cubit.

007:033 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot
        wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes,
        and their spokes, were all molten.

007:034 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one
        base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.

007:035 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
        cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and
        the borders thereof were of the same.

007:036 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders
        thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according
        to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.

007:037 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one
        casting, one measure, and one size.

007:038 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty
        baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of
        the ten bases one laver.

007:039 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five
        on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right
        side of the house eastward over against the south.

007:040 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
        Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king
        Solomon for the house of the LORD:

007:041 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were
        on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover
        the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the
        pillars;

007:042 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two
        rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls
        of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;

007:043 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;

007:044 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;

007:045 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these
        vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the
        LORD, were of bright brass.

007:046 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
        ground between Succoth and Zarthan.

007:047 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
        exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.

007:048 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house
        of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold,
        whereupon the shewbread was,

007:049 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and
        five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the
        lamps, and the tongs of gold,

007:050 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the
        spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold,
        both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place,
        and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.

007:051 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house
        of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his
        father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the
        vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the
        LORD.

008:001 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
        of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
        Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring
        up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of
        David, which is Zion.

008:002 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king
        Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the
        seventh month.

008:003 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the
        ark.

008:004 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of
        the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
        tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring
        up.

008:005 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that
        were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark,
        sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor
        numbered for multitude.

008:006 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy
        place, even under the wings of the cherubims.

008:007 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place
        of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
        thereof above.

008:008 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
        seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were
        not seen without: and there they are unto this day.

008:009 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone,
        which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant
        with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of
        Egypt.

008:010 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
        holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,

008:011 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the
        cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the
        LORD.

008:012 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the
        thick darkness.

008:013 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
        for thee to abide in for ever.

008:014 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the
        congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel
        stood;)

008:015 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake
        with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand
        fulfilled it, saying,

008:016 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of
        Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to
        build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose
        David to be over my people Israel.

008:017 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
        for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

008:018 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in
        thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well
        that it was in thine heart.

008:019 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
        shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house
        unto my name.

008:020 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
        risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne
        of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for
        the name of the LORD God of Israel.

008:021 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the
        covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he
        brought them out of the land of Egypt.

008:022 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence
        of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands
        toward heaven:

008:023 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in
        heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and
        mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their
        heart:

008:024 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
        promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast
        fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

008:025 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David
        my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not
        fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so
        that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk
        before me as thou hast walked before me.

008:026 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be
        verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.

008:027 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
        heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this
        house that I have builded?

008:028 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to
        his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
        to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:

008:029 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
        even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall
        be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy
        servant shall make toward this place.

008:030 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of
        thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and
        hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest,
        forgive.

008:031 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid
        upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine
        altar in this house:

008:032 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants,
        condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and
        justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
        righteousness.

008:033 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy,
        because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to
        thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication
        unto thee in this house:

008:034 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people
        Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest
        unto their fathers.

008:035 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
        have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and
        confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou
        afflictest them:

008:036 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants,
        and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way
        wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which
        thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.

008:037 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
        blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their
        enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever
        plague, whatsoever sickness there be;

008:038 What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by
        all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague
        of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this
        house:

008:039 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and
        do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart
        thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of
        all the children of men;)

008:040 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the
        land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

008:041 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people
        Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;

008:042 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong
        hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and
        pray toward this house;

008:043 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to
        all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of
        the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people
        Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have
        builded, is called by thy name.

008:044 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy,
        whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the
        LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the
        house that I have built for thy name:

008:045 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
        and maintain their cause.

008:046 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth
        not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the
        enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of
        the enemy, far or near;

008:047 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
        were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto
        thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying,
        We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed
        wickedness;

008:048 And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all
        their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away
        captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou
        gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen,
        and the house which I have built for thy name:

008:049 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven
        thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,

008:050 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all
        their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against
        thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them
        captive, that they may have compassion on them:

008:051 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
        broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace
        of iron:

008:052 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy
        servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to
        hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.

008:053 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the
        earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of
        Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of
        Egypt, O LORD God.

008:054 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying
        all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from
        before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with
        his hands spread up to heaven.

008:055 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with
        a loud voice, saying,

008:056 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people
        Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not
        failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by
        the hand of Moses his servant.

008:057 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let
        him not leave us, nor forsake us:

008:058 That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his
        ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his
        judgments, which he commanded our fathers.

008:059 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication
        before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night,
        that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of
        his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:

008:060 That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is
        God, and that there is none else.

008:061 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to
        walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this
        day.

008:062 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice
        before the LORD.

008:063 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
        offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an
        hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the
        children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.

008:064 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that
        was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
        offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace
        offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD
        was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat
        offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.

008:065 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with
        him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto
        the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and
        seven days, even fourteen days.

008:066 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed
        the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart
        for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his
        servant, and for Israel his people.

009:001 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of
        the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's
        desire which he was pleased to do,

009:002 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had
        appeared unto him at Gibeon.

009:003 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
        supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed
        this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for
        ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

009:004 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked,
        in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to
        all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and
        my judgments:

009:005 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel
        for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There
        shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.

009:006 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
        children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes
        which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and
        worship them:

009:007 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
        them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will
        I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a
        byword among all people:

009:008 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it
        shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why
        hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?

009:009 And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their
        God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
        and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them,
        and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all
        this evil.

009:010 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon
        had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the
        king's house,

009:011 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
        trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his
        desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in
        the land of Galilee.

009:012 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon
        had given him; and they pleased him not.

009:013 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me,
        my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this
        day.

009:014 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

009:015 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised;
        for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and
        Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and
        Gezer.

009:016 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and
        burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the
        city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's
        wife.

009:017 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,

009:018 And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,

009:019 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for
        his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which
        Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in
        all the land of his dominion.

009:020 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
        Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the
        children of Israel,

009:021 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the
        children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon
        those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.

009:022 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but
        they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and
        his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.

009:023 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's
        work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people
        that wrought in the work.

009:024 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto
        her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build
        Millo.

009:025 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings
        and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the
        LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the
        LORD. So he finished the house.

009:026 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
        beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of
        Edom.

009:027 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
        knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

009:028 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
        hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

010:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
        concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with
        hard questions.

010:002 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
        that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and
        when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all
        that was in her heart.

010:003 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any
        thing hid from the king, which he told her not.

010:004 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and
        the house that he had built,

010:005 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
        and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and
        his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the
        house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.

010:006 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in
        mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.

010:007 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes
        had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom
        and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.

010:008 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
        continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.

010:009 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set
        thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel
        for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and
        justice.

010:010 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
        and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there
        came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen
        of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

010:011 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,
        brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and
        precious stones.

010:012 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
        the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries
        for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen
        unto this day.

010:013 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
        whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of
        his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country,
        she and her servants.

010:014 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
        six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,

010:015 Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of
        the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of
        the governors of the country.

010:016 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
        hundred shekels of gold went to one target.

010:017 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound
        of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house
        of the forest of Lebanon.

010:018 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
        it with the best gold.

010:019 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
        behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of
        the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.

010:020 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
        upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any
        kingdom.

010:021 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all
        the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure
        gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the
        days of Solomon.

010:022 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of
        Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish,
        bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

010:023 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches
        and for wisdom.

010:024 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which
        God had put in his heart.

010:025 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
        vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses,
        and mules, a rate year by year.

010:026 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he
        had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
        horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and
        with the king at Jerusalem.

010:027 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and
        cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the
        vale, for abundance.

010:028 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
        the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

010:029 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
        shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and
        so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of
        Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

011:001 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
        daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites,
        Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:

011:002 Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the
        children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall
        they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your
        heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.

011:003 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
        concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

011:004 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives
        turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not
        perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his
        father.

011:005 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
        and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

011:006 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not
        fully after the LORD, as did David his father.

011:007 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the
        abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and
        for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.

011:008 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
        incense and sacrificed unto their gods.

011:009 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was
        turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto
        him twice,

011:010 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should
        not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD
        commanded.

011:011 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is
        done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my
        statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the
        kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.

011:012 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
        father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.

011:013 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give
        one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for
        Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.

011:014 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
        Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.

011:015 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
        captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he
        had smitten every male in Edom;

011:016 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until
        he had cut off every male in Edom:)

011:017 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's
        servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little
        child.

011:018 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took
        men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto
        Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed
        him victuals, and gave him land.

011:019 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that
        he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of
        Tahpenes the queen.

011:020 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
        Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in
        Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.

011:021 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his
        fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad
        said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own
        country.

011:022 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
        that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he
        answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.

011:023 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
        Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:

011:024 And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band,
        when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and
        dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.

011:025 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
        beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel,
        and reigned over Syria.

011:026 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
        Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow
        woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.

011:027 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
        king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the
        city of David his father.

011:028 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
        seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him
        ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.

011:029 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
        Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in
        the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they
        two were alone in the field:

011:030 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it
        in twelve pieces:

011:031 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith
        the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom
        out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:

011:032 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and
        for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all
        the tribes of Israel:)

011:033 Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped
        Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the
        Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and
        have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine
        eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David
        his father.

011:034 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but
        I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my
        servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments
        and my statutes:

011:035 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
        give it unto thee, even ten tribes.

011:036 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
        may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which
        I have chosen me to put my name there.

011:037 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all
        that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.

011:038 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
        thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my
        sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my
        servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure
        house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.

011:039 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for
        ever.

011:040 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
        and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in
        Egypt until the death of Solomon.

011:041 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and
        his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of
        Solomon?

011:042 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
        was forty years.

011:043 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
        of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
        stead.

012:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to
        Shechem to make him king.

012:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
        yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence
        of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)

012:003 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the
        congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,

012:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the
        grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he
        put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.

012:005 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come
        again to me. And the people departed.

012:006 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood
        before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do
        ye advise that I may answer this people?

012:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant
        unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer
        them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy
        servants for ever.

012:008 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had
        given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up
        with him, and which stood before him:

012:009 And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer
        this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke
        which thy father did put upon us lighter?

012:010 And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,
        saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto
        thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
        lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little
        finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

012:011 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I
        will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with
        whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

012:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
        as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third
        day.

012:013 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
        men's counsel that they gave him;

012:014 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
        My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke:
        my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
        you with scorpions.

012:015 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the
        cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying,
        which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the
        son of Nebat.

012:016 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,
        the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in
        David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to
        your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So
        Israel departed unto their tents.

012:017 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
        Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

012:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and
        all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore
        king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee
        to Jerusalem.

012:019 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

012:020 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
        come again, that they sent and called him unto the
        congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was
        none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah
        only.

012:021 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the
        house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and
        fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight
        against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to
        Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

012:022 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

012:023 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and
        unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant
        of the people, saying,

012:024 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
        your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his
        house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to
        the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the
        word of the LORD.

012:025 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt
        therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.

012:026 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return
        to the house of David:

012:027 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD
        at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again
        unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they
        shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.

012:028 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
        and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to
        Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up
        out of the land of Egypt.

012:029 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.

012:030 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship
        before the one, even unto Dan.

012:031 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
        lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

012:032 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
        fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in
        Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel,
        sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in
        Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.

012:033 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
        fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he
        had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the
        children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt
        incense.

013:001 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
        of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to
        burn incense.

013:002 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and
        said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child
        shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and
        upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that
        burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon
        thee.

013:003 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign
        which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent,
        and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.

013:004 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of
        the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel,
        that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on
        him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,
        so that he could not pull it in again to him.

013:005 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the
        altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by
        the word of the LORD.

013:006 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat
        now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my
        hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the
        LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became
        as it was before.

013:007 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
        refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

013:008 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me
        half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I
        eat bread nor drink water in this place:

013:009 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat
        no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that
        thou camest.

013:010 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he
        came to Bethel.

013:011 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came
        and told him all the works that the man of God had done that
        day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king,
        them they told also to their father.

013:012 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his
        sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from
        Judah.

013:013 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
        him the ass: and he rode thereon,

013:014 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an
        oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest
        from Judah? And he said, I am.

013:015 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

013:016 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
        neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this
        place:

013:017 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat
        no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the
        way that thou camest.

013:018 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an
        angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him
        back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and
        drink water. But he lied unto him.

013:019 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and
        drank water.

013:020 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word
        of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:

013:021 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying,
        Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the
        mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the
        LORD thy God commanded thee,

013:022 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the
        place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread,
        and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the
        sepulchre of thy fathers.

013:023 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he
        had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the
        prophet whom he had brought back.

013:024 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
        and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it,
        the lion also stood by the carcase.

013:025 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the
        way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and
        told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.

013:026 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
        thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient
        unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered
        him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him,
        according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.

013:027 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
        saddled him.

013:028 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
        and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten
        the carcase, nor torn the ass.

013:029 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and
        laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet
        came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.

013:030 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned
        over him, saying, Alas, my brother!

013:031 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to
        his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the
        sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones
        beside his bones:

013:032 For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against
        the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high
        places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come
        to pass.

013:033 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
        made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high
        places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one
        of the priests of the high places.

013:034 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to
        cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

014:001 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

014:002 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and
        disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of
        Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the
        prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.

014:003 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
        honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of
        the child.

014:004 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
        came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his
        eyes were set by reason of his age.

014:005 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
        cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick:
        thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when
        she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another
        woman.

014:006 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she
        came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of
        Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am
        sent to thee with heavy tidings.

014:007 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
        Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made
        thee prince over my people Israel,

014:008 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it
        thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept
        my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do
        that only which was right in mine eyes;

014:009 But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou
        hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to
        provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:

014:010 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of
        Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth
        against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
        and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a
        man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.

014:011 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and
        him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat:
        for the LORD hath spoken it.

014:012 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when
        thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.

014:013 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only
        of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is
        found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the
        house of Jeroboam.

014:014 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
        shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even
        now.

014:015 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
        water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land,
        which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond
        the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the
        LORD to anger.

014:016 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
        who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.

014:017 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
        and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child
        died;

014:018 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according
        to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his
        servant Ahijah the prophet.

014:019 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how
        he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Israel.

014:020 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
        and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in
        his stead.

014:021 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was
        forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
        seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did
        choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.
        And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.

014:022 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
        him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed,
        above all that their fathers had done.

014:023 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves,
        on every high hill, and under every green tree.

014:024 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did
        according to all the abominations of the nations which the
        LORD cast out before the children of Israel.

014:025 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
        Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:

014:026 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and
        the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and
        he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

014:027 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
        committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which
        kept the door of the king's house.

014:028 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,
        that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard
        chamber.

014:029 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

014:030 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their
        days.

014:031 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah
        an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

015:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
        reigned Abijam over Judah.

015:002 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was
        Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

015:003 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
        before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his
        God, as the heart of David his father.

015:004 Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a
        lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to
        establish Jerusalem:

015:005 Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the
        LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded
        him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah
        the Hittite.

015:006 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
        of his life.

015:007 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

015:008 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the
        city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

015:009 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned
        Asa over Judah.

015:010 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

015:011 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as
        did David his father.

015:012 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed
        all the idols that his fathers had made.

015:013 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being
        queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa
        destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.

015:014 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart
        was perfect with the LORD all his days.

015:015 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated,
        and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of
        the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.

015:016 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
        their days.

015:017 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
        Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to
        Asa king of Judah.

015:018 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in
        the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
        the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his
        servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of
        Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at
        Damascus, saying,

015:019 There is a league between me and thee, and between my father
        and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of
        silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of
        Israel, that he may depart from me.

015:020 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
        the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote
        Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with
        all the land of Naphtali.

015:021 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left
        off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

015:022 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none
        was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the
        timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa
        built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

015:023 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all
        that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
        Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his
        feet.

015:024 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his
        son reigned in his stead.

015:025 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in
        the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel
        two years.

015:026 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
        way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
        sin.

015:027 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
        conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon,
        which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
        laid siege to Gibbethon.

015:028 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay
        him, and reigned in his stead.

015:029 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
        house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed,
        until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the
        LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:

015:030 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he
        made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the
        LORD God of Israel to anger.

015:031 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

015:032 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
        their days.

015:033 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of
        Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four
        years.

015:034 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
        way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
        sin.

016:001 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani
        against Baasha, saying,

016:002 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee
        prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way
        of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke
        me to anger with their sins;

016:003 Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the
        posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house
        of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

016:004 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and
        him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air
        eat.

016:005 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
        might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
        the kings of Israel?

016:006 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah:
        and Elah his son reigned in his stead.

016:007 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani
        came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his
        house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the
        LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in
        being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.

016:008 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah
        the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.

016:009 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
        against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in
        the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.

016:010 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty
        and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his
        stead.

016:011 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
        on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left
        him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his
        kinsfolks, nor of his friends.

016:012 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to
        the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu
        the prophet.

016:013 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by
        which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in
        provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

016:014 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

016:015 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
        reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped
        against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.

016:016 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
        conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel
        made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day
        in the camp.

016:017 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and
        they besieged Tirzah.

016:018 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
        that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt
        the king's house over him with fire, and died.

016:019 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
        LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which
        he did, to make Israel to sin.

016:020 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
        wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
        the kings of Israel?

016:021 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of
        the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king;
        and half followed Omri.

016:022 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
        that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri
        reigned.

016:023 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri
        to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in
        Tirzah.

016:024 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
        silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city
        which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill,
        Samaria.

016:025 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse
        than all that were before him.

016:026 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and
        in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the
        LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

016:027 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
        that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Israel?

016:028 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and
        Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

016:029 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
        Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of
        Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.

016:030 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD
        above all that were before him.

016:031 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him
        to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took
        to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians,
        and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.

016:032 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which
        he had built in Samaria.

016:033 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD
        God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were
        before him.

016:034 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
        foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the
        gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word
        of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

017:001 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
        said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom
        I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but
        according to my word.

017:002 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

017:003 Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by
        the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

017:004 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I
        have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

017:005 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he
        went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

017:006 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and
        bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

017:007 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
        because there had been no rain in the land.

017:008 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

017:009 Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and
        dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to
        sustain thee.

017:010 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the
        gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering
        of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray
        thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.

017:011 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
        Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.

017:012 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake,
        but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a
        cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go
        in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and
        die.

017:013 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast
        said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it
        unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.

017:014 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal
        shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until
        the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.

017:015 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and
        she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.

017:016 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of
        oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by
        Elijah.

017:017 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the
        woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness
        was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.

017:018 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
        man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to
        remembrance, and to slay my son?

017:019 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of
        her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and
        laid him upon his own bed.

017:020 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou
        also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by
        slaying her son?

017:021 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried
        unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this
        child's soul come into him again.

017:022 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
        child came into him again, and he revived.

017:023 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
        chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and
        Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.

017:024 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art
        a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is
        truth.

018:001 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
        came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself
        unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.

018:002 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a
        sore famine in Samaria.

018:003 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
        (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:

018:004 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,
        that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty
        in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)

018:005 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all
        fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may
        find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose
        not all the beasts.

018:006 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
        Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by
        himself.

018:007 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
        knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my
        lord Elijah?

018:008 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah
        is here.

018:009 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver
        thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?

018:010 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,
        whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they
        said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and
        nation, that they found thee not.

018:011 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
        here.

018:012 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee,
        that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know
        not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find
        thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from
        my youth.

018:013 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
        prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's
        prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and
        water?

018:014 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
        here: and he shall slay me.

018:015 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
        stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.

018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to
        meet Elijah.

018:017 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
        him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?

018:018 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy
        father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of
        the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.

018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount
        Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and
        the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at
        Jezebel's table.

018:020 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
        prophets together unto mount Carmel.

018:021 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt
        ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but
        if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a
        word.

018:022 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a
        prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and
        fifty men.

018:023 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose
        one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it
        on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other
        bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:

018:024 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the
        name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him
        be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well
        spoken.

018:025 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
        bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many;
        and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.

018:026 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they
        dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even
        until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice,
        nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which
        was made.

018:027 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and
        said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he
        is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he
        sleepeth, and must be awaked.

018:028 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
        with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.

018:029 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
        until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that
        there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that
        regarded.

018:030 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And
        all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar
        of the LORD that was broken down.

018:031 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the
        tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD
        came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:

018:032 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD:
        and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would
        contain two measures of seed.

018:033 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces,
        and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with
        water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

018:034 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second
        time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the
        third time.

018:035 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
        trench also with water.

018:036 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
        sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD
        God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day
        that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and
        that I have done all these things at thy word.

018:037 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou
        art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back
        again.

018:038 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt
        sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and
        licked up the water that was in the trench.

018:039 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and
        they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.

018:040 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
        one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought
        them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.

018:041 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for
        there is a sound of abundance of rain.

018:042 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the
        top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and
        put his face between his knees,

018:043 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And
        he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he
        said, Go again seven times.

018:044 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
        there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's
        hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot,
        and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.

018:045 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was
        black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And
        Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.

018:046 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
        loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

019:001 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how
        he had slain all the prophets with the sword.

019:002 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
        gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the
        life of one of them by to morrow about this time.

019:003 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and
        came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his
        servant there.

019:004 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and
        came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for
        himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O
        LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.

019:005 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an
        angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.

019:006 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the
        coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and
        drink, and laid him down again.

019:007 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and
        touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is
        too great for thee.

019:008 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength
        of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount
        of God.

019:009 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and,
        behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto
        him, What doest thou here, Elijah?

019:010 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
        hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
        thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the
        sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to
        take it away.

019:011 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the
        LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong
        wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before
        the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind
        an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:

019:012 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the
        fire: and after the fire a still small voice.

019:013 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face
        in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of
        the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said,
        What doest thou here, Elijah?

019:014 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
        hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy
        covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets
        with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my
        life, to take it away.

019:015 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the
        wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to
        be king over Syria:

019:016 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over
        Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt
        thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.

019:017 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of
        Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword
        of Jehu shall Elisha slay.

019:018 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees
        which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not
        kissed him.

019:019 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
        who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he
        with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his
        mantle upon him.

019:020 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me,
        I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will
        follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what
        have I done to thee?

019:021 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and
        slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the
        oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he
        arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

020:001 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:
        and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and
        chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred
        against it.

020:002 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city,
        and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,

020:003 Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy
        children, even the goodliest, are mine.

020:004 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,
        according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.

020:005 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh
        Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou
        shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and
        thy children;

020:006 Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this
        time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy
        servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in
        thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.

020:007 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and
        said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief:
        for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for
        my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.

020:008 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken
        not unto him, nor consent.

020:009 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my
        lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at
        the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the
        messengers departed, and brought him word again.

020:010 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,
        and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for
        handfuls for all the people that follow me.

020:011 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not
        him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that
        putteth it off.

020:012 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he
        was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said
        unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set
        themselves in array against the city.

020:013 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
        saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great
        multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day;
        and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

020:014 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even
        by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he
        said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.

020:015 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the
        provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after
        them he numbered all the people, even all the children of
        Israel, being seven thousand.

020:016 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself
        drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two
        kings that helped him.

020:017 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
        first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There
        are men come out of Samaria.

020:018 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them
        alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.

020:019 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
        the city, and the army which followed them.

020:020 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
        Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on
        an horse with the horsemen.

020:021 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and
        chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

020:022 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,
        Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for
        at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up
        against thee.

020:023 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their
        gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than
        we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we
        shall be stronger than they.

020:024 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his
        place, and put captains in their rooms:

020:025 And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost,
        horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight
        against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger
        than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.

020:026 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
        numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against
        Israel.

020:027 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all
        present, and went against them: and the children of Israel
        pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the
        Syrians filled the country.

020:028 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of
        Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians
        have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of
        the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude
        into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

020:029 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so
        it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the
        children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand
        footmen in one day.

020:030 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall
        fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left.
        And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner
        chamber.

020:031 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that
        the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I
        pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our
        heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will
        save thy life.

020:032 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on
        their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy
        servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said,
        Is he yet alive? he is my brother.

020:033 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would
        come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy
        brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then
        Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into
        the chariot.

020:034 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took
        from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets
        for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said
        Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a
        covenant with him, and sent him away.

020:035 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
        neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And
        the man refused to smite him.

020:036 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice
        of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a
        lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him,
        a lion found him, and slew him.

020:037 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.
        And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.

020:038 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,
        and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.

020:039 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he
        said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and,
        behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and
        said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall
        thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of
        silver.

020:040 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And
        the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be;
        thyself hast decided it.

020:041 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the
        king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.

020:042 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast
        let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter
        destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy
        people for his people.

020:043 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,
        and came to Samaria.

021:001 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the
        Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the
        palace of Ahab king of Samaria.

021:002 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that
        I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto
        my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than
        it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of
        it in money.

021:003 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should
        give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.

021:004 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of
        the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he
        had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.
        And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face,
        and would eat no bread.

021:005 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is
        thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?

021:006 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the
        Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money;
        or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard
        for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.

021:007 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
        kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart
        be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the
        Jezreelite.

021:008 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his
        seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles
        that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.

021:009 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
        Naboth on high among the people:

021:010 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness
        against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king.
        And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.

021:011 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who
        were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto
        them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent
        unto them.

021:012 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the
        people.

021:013 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before
        him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against
        Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did
        blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of
        the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.

021:014 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
        dead.

021:015 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was
        stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take
        possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he
        refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but
        dead.

021:016 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
        that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the
        Jezreelite, to take possession of it.

021:017 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

021:018 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in
        Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he
        is gone down to possess it.

021:019 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,
        Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt
        speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place
        where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy
        blood, even thine.

021:020 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And
        he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself
        to work evil in the sight of the LORD.

021:021 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
        posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against
        the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,

021:022 And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son
        of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for
        the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and
        made Israel to sin.

021:023 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
        Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.

021:024 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him
        that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.

021:025 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to
        work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his
        wife stirred up.

021:026 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to
        all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before
        the children of Israel.

021:027 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent
        his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and
        lay in sackcloth, and went softly.

021:028 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

021:029 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he
        humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his
        days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his
        house.

022:001 And they continued three years without war between Syria and
        Israel.

022:002 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the
        king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.

022:003 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that
        Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out
        of the hand of the king of Syria?

022:004 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle
        to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I
        am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy
        horses.

022:005 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
        thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

022:006 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about
        four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against
        Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
        up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

022:007 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
        besides, that we might enquire of him?

022:008 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
        man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the
        LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning
        me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

022:009 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
        hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.

022:010 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
        each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place
        in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets
        prophesied before them.

022:011 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and
        he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the
        Syrians, until thou have consumed them.

022:012 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
        Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
        the king's hand.

022:013 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto
        him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare
        good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee,
        be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.

022:014 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto
        me, that will I speak.

022:015 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
        shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we
        forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD
        shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

022:016 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee
        that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name
        of the LORD?

022:017 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as
        sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have
        no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.

022:018 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
        thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?

022:019 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw
        the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven
        standing by him on his right hand and on his left.

022:020 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up
        and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and
        another said on that manner.

022:021 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
        said, I will persuade him.

022:022 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
        forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
        prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail
        also: go forth, and do so.

022:023 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
        mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
        concerning thee.

022:024 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
        on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD
        from me to speak unto thee?

022:025 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when
        thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

022:026 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
        unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
        son;

022:027 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
        and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
        affliction, until I come in peace.

022:028 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD
        hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every
        one of you.

022:029 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
        up to Ramothgilead.

022:030 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
        myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.
        And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the
        battle.

022:031 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains
        that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with
        small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.

022:032 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
        Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.
        And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat
        cried out.

022:033 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots
        perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned
        back from pursuing him.

022:034 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
        of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said
        unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me
        out of the host; for I am wounded.

022:035 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up
        in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the
        blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.

022:036 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the
        going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and
        every man to his own country.

022:037 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
        the king in Samaria.

022:038 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the
        dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour;
        according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.

022:039 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
        ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built,
        are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?

022:040 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in
        his stead.

022:041 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in
        the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

022:042 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to
        reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And
        his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

022:043 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not
        aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the
        LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for
        the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.

022:044 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

022:045 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
        shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of
        the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

022:046 And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days
        of his father Asa, he took out of the land.

022:047 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.

022:048 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold:
        but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.

022:049 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my
        servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat
        would not.

022:050 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
        his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his
        son reigned in his stead.

022:051 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
        the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned
        two years over Israel.

022:052 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
        way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the
        way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:

022:053 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger
        the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had
        done.

Book 12	2 Kings

001:001 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

001:002 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber
        that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and
        said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron
        whether I shall recover of this disease.

001:003 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise,
        go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say
        unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel,
        that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?

001:004 Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down
        from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
        And Elijah departed.

001:005 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto
        them, Why are ye now turned back?

001:006 And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and
        said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and
        say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is
        not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub
        the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that
        bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

001:007 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up
        to meet you, and told you these words?

001:008 And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a
        girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah
        the Tishbite.

001:009 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty.
        And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an
        hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath
        said, Come down.

001:010 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be
        a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume
        thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and
        consumed him and his fifty.

001:011 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
        fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus
        hath the king said, Come down quickly.

001:012 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God,
        let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy
        fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed
        him and his fifty.

001:013 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
        And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on
        his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him,
        O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these
        fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.

001:014 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
        captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore
        let my life now be precious in thy sight.

001:015 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him:
        be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him
        unto the king.

001:016 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou
        hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron,
        is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his
        word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which
        thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

001:017 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had
        spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of
        Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had
        no son.

001:018 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

002:001 And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into
        heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from
        Gilgal.

002:002 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the
        LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the
        LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So
        they went down to Bethel.

002:003 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to
        Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
        take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I
        know it; hold ye your peace.

002:004 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for
        the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD
        liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they
        came to Jericho.

002:005 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to
        Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
        take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered,
        Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.

002:006 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the
        LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth,
        and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two
        went on.

002:007 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to
        view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.

002:008 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote
        the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that
        they two went over on dry ground.

002:009 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah
        said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be
        taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a
        double portion of thy spirit be upon me.

002:010 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if
        thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto
        thee; but if not, it shall not be so.

002:011 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
        behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,
        and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a
        whirlwind into heaven.

002:012 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the
        chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no
        more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in
        two pieces.

002:013 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and
        went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;

002:014 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote
        the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and
        when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and
        thither: and Elisha went over.

002:015 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at
        Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on
        Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the
        ground before him.

002:016 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants
        fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy
        master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken
        him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.
        And he said, Ye shall not send.

002:017 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.
        They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but
        found him not.

002:018 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,)
        he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

002:019 And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee,
        the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but
        the water is naught, and the ground barren.

002:020 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And
        they brought it to him.

002:021 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the
        salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed
        these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or
        barren land.

002:022 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the
        saying of Elisha which he spake.

002:023 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up
        by the way, there came forth little children out of the city,
        and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go
        up, thou bald head.

002:024 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the
        name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of
        the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.

002:025 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he
        returned to Samaria.

003:001 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in
        Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and
        reigned twelve years.

003:002 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his
        father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal
        that his father had made.

003:003 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
        Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

003:004 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto
        the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred
        thousand rams, with the wool.

003:005 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
        rebelled against the king of Israel.

003:006 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and
        numbered all Israel.

003:007 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying,
        The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with
        me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as
        thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy
        horses.

003:008 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The
        way through the wilderness of Edom.

003:009 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the
        king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days'
        journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the
        cattle that followed them.

003:010 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called
        these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of
        Moab!

003:011 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,
        that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of
        Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of
        Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.

003:012 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the
        king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down
        to him.

003:013 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do
        with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the
        prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him,
        Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to
        deliver them into the hand of Moab.

003:014 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
        stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of
        Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee,
        nor see thee.

003:015 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
        minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.

003:016 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of
        ditches.

003:017 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall
        ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that
        ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.

003:018 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he
        will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.

003:019 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city,
        and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water,
        and mar every good piece of land with stones.

003:020 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was
        offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom,
        and the country was filled with water.

003:021 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to
        fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on
        armour, and upward, and stood in the border.

003:022 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon
        the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as
        red as blood:

003:023 And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and
        they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the
        spoil.

003:024 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose
        up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but
        they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.

003:025 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land
        cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all
        the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in
        Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers
        went about it, and smote it.

003:026 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for
        him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to
        break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.

003:027 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
        stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And
        there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed
        from him, and returned to their own land.

004:001 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of
        the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is
        dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and
        the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be
        bondmen.

004:002 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me,
        what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath
        not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.

004:003 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
        neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.

004:004 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee
        and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels,
        and thou shalt set aside that which is full.

004:005 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
        sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.

004:006 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
        unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,
        There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.

004:007 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell
        the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of
        the rest.

004:008 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was
        a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it
        was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat
        bread.

004:009 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that
        this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.

004:010 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and
        let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and
        a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he
        shall turn in thither.

004:011 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into
        the chamber, and lay there.

004:012 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And
        when he had called her, she stood before him.

004:013 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
        careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for
        thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the
        captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own
        people.

004:014 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi
        answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

004:015 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood
        in the door.

004:016 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,
        thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man
        of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.

004:017 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
        Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.

004:018 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went
        out to his father to the reapers.

004:019 And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to
        a lad, Carry him to his mother.

004:020 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he
        sat on her knees till noon, and then died.

004:021 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God,
        and shut the door upon him, and went out.

004:022 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray
        thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may
        run to the man of God, and come again.

004:023 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is
        neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.

004:024 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and
        go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.

004:025 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And
        it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he
        said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:

004:026 Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it
        well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with
        the child? And she answered, It is well:

004:027 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught
        him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And
        the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed
        within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not
        told me.

004:028 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say,
        Do not deceive me?

004:029 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff
        in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute
        him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay
        my staff upon the face of the child.

004:030 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as
        thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and
        followed her.

004:031 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the
        face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.
        Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The
        child is not awaked.

004:032 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was
        dead, and laid upon his bed.

004:033 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
        prayed unto the LORD.

004:034 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon
        his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his
        hands: and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of
        the child waxed warm.

004:035 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
        up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed
        seven times, and the child opened his eyes.

004:036 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
        called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take
        up thy son.

004:037 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to
        the ground, and took up her son, and went out.

004:038 And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the
        land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him:
        and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe
        pottage for the sons of the prophets.

004:039 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a
        wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and
        came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew
        them not.

004:040 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as
        they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and
        said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they
        could not eat thereof.

004:041 But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and
        he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there
        was no harm in the pot.

004:042 And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of
        God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and
        full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto
        the people, that they may eat.

004:043 And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an
        hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may
        eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave
        thereof.

004:044 So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
        according to the word of the LORD.

005:001 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a
        great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the
        LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty
        man in valour, but he was a leper.

005:002 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought
        away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she
        waited on Naaman's wife.

005:003 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with
        the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of
        his leprosy.

005:004 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said
        the maid that is of the land of Israel.

005:005 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a
        letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with
        him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold,
        and ten changes of raiment.

005:006 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now
        when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith
        sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him
        of his leprosy.

005:007 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the
        letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill
        and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover
        a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see
        how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

005:008 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the
        king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king,
        saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now
        to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

005:009 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood
        at the door of the house of Elisha.

005:010 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in
        Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee,
        and thou shalt be clean.

005:011 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I
        thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on
        the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the
        place, and recover the leper.

005:012 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all
        the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So
        he turned and went away in a rage.

005:013 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My
        father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing,
        wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he
        saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?

005:014 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
        according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came
        again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

005:015 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and
        came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know
        that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now
        therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.

005:016 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will
        receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.

005:017 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given
        to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant
        will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice
        unto other gods, but unto the LORD.

005:018 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master
        goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he
        leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon:
        when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon
        thy servant in this thing.

005:019 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a
        little way.

005:020 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,
        Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not
        receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD
        liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.

005:021 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him
        running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet
        him, and said, Is all well?

005:022 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying,
        Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two
        young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee,
        a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.

005:023 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged
        him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two
        changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants;
        and they bare them before him.

005:024 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand,
        and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and
        they departed.

005:025 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said
        unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant
        went no whither.

005:026 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the
        man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time
        to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and
        vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
        maidservants?

005:027 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and
        unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a
        leper as white as snow.

006:001 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the
        place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.

006:002 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every
        man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may
        dwell. And he answered, Go ye.

006:003 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy
        servants. And he answered, I will go.

006:004 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut
        down wood.

006:005 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the
        water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was
        borrowed.

006:006 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
        place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and
        the iron did swim.

006:007 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his
        hand, and took it.

006:008 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
        with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be
        my camp.

006:009 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying,
        Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the
        Syrians are come down.

006:010 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
        told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once
        nor twice.

006:011 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for
        this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them,
        Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?

006:012 And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but
        Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of
        Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.

006:013 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
        him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.

006:014 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great
        host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.

006:015 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and
        gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with
        horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my
        master! how shall we do?

006:016 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more
        than they that be with them.

006:017 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,
        that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young
        man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses
        and chariots of fire round about Elisha.

006:018 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD,
        and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And
        he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.

006:019 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is
        this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom
        ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.

006:020 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
        Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may
        see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and,
        behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.

006:021 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
        father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?

006:022 And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou
        smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and
        with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may
        eat and drink, and go to their master.

006:023 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had
        eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their
        master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of
        Israel.

006:024 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria
        gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.

006:025 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they
        besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces
        of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for
        five pieces of silver.

006:026 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there
        cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.

006:027 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help
        thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?

006:028 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
        answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may
        eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.

006:029 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on
        the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath
        hid her son.

006:030 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the
        woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the
        wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth
        within upon his flesh.

006:031 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
        Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.

006:032 But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and
        the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger
        came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a
        murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the
        messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the
        door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?

006:033 And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came
        down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD;
        what should I wait for the LORD any longer?

007:001 Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the
        LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour
        be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,
        in the gate of Samaria.

007:002 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of
        God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in
        heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt
        see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

007:003 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the
        gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we
        die?

007:004 If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in
        the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we
        die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of
        the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they
        kill us, we shall but die.

007:005 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
        Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the
        camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.

007:006 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise
        of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great
        host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel
        hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings
        of the Egyptians, to come upon us.

007:007 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their
        tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it
        was, and fled for their life.

007:008 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp,
        they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried
        thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and
        came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence
        also, and went and hid it.

007:009 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a
        day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till
        the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now
        therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.

007:010 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they
        told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and,
        behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but
        horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.

007:011 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's
        house within.

007:012 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I
        will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know
        that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to
        hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of
        the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.

007:013 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I
        pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in
        the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel
        that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the
        multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us
        send and see.

007:014 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent
        after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

007:015 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was
        full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away
        in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the
        king.

007:016 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.
        So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two
        measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the
        LORD.

007:017 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to
        have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in
        the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake
        when the king came down to him.

007:018 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
        saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of
        fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in
        the gate of Samaria:

007:019 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,
        if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing
        be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,
        but shalt not eat thereof.

007:020 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in
        the gate, and he died.

008:001 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to
        life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and
        sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath
        called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land
        seven years.

008:002 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of
        God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the
        land of the Philistines seven years.

008:003 And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman
        returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went
        forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.

008:004 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
        saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha
        hath done.

008:005 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
        restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose
        son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house
        and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is
        the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.

008:006 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
        appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that
        was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that
        she left the land, even until now.

008:007 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria
        was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come
        hither.

008:008 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand,
        and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him,
        saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

008:009 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even
        of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and
        came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of
        Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this
        disease?

008:010 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest
        certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he
        shall surely die.

008:011 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was
        ashamed: and the man of God wept.

008:012 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because
        I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel:
        their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men
        wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children,
        and rip up their women with child.

008:013 And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he
        should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath
        shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.

008:014 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said
        to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me
        that thou shouldest surely recover.

008:015 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
        and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he
        died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.

008:016 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
        Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je
        hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.

008:017 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
        reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

008:018 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the
        house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he
        did evil in the sight of the LORD.

008:019 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's
        sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his
        children.

008:020 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and
        made a king over themselves.

008:021 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and
        he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him
        about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled
        into their tents.

008:022 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
        Then Libnah revolted at the same time.

008:023 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

008:024 And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in
        his stead.

008:025 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel
        did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.

008:026 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign;
        and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
        was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.

008:027 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in
        the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was
        the son in law of the house of Ahab.

008:028 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against
        Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded
        Joram.

008:029 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
        which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought
        against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram
        king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in
        Jezreel, because he was sick.

009:001 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the
        prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this
        box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:

009:002 And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
        Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise
        up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;

009:003 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say,
        Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
        Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.

009:004 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
        Ramothgilead.

009:005 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were
        sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And
        Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O
        captain.

009:006 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil
        on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
        Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD,
        even over Israel.

009:007 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
        avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of
        all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.

009:008 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off
        from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is
        shut up and left in Israel:

009:009 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam
        the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of
        Ahijah:

009:010 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and
        there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and
        fled.

009:011 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said
        unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?
        And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.

009:012 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and
        thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have
        anointed thee king over Israel.

009:013 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it
        under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets,
        saying, Jehu is king.

009:014 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
        against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all
        Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.

009:015 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the
        wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with
        Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds,
        then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to
        tell it in Jezreel.

009:016 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay
        there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.

009:017 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he
        spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a
        company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet
        them, and let him say, Is it peace?

009:018 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus
        saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to
        do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told,
        saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.

009:019 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them,
        and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered,
        What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.

009:020 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and
        cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu
        the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.

009:021 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready.
        And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out,
        each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met
        him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.

009:022 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
        peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the
        whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so
        many?

009:023 And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,
        There is treachery, O Ahaziah.

009:024 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
        between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he
        sunk down in his chariot.

009:025 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in
        the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for
        remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab
        his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;

009:026 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the
        blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in
        this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him
        into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.

009:027 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the
        way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and
        said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the
        going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo,
        and died there.

009:028 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
        buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of
        David.

009:029 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began
        Ahaziah to reign over Judah.

009:030 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and
        she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a
        window.

009:031 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,
        who slew his master?

009:032 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on
        my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three
        eunuchs.

009:033 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some
        of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and
        he trode her under foot.

009:034 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go,
        see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's
        daughter.

009:035 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than
        the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

009:036 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is
        the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the
        Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the
        flesh of Jezebel:

009:037 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of
        the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not
        say, This is Jezebel.

010:001 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters,
        and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the
        elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,

010:002 Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's
        sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses,
        a fenced city also, and armour;

010:003 Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and
        set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's
        house.

010:004 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings
        stood not before him: how then shall we stand?

010:005 And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city,
        the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to
        Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou
        shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is
        good in thine eyes.

010:006 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye
        be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the
        heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel
        by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy
        persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought
        them up.

010:007 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they
        took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their
        heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.

010:008 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
        brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them
        in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.

010:009 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and
        stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I
        conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all
        these?

010:010 Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the
        word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of
        Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his
        servant Elijah.

010:011 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in
        Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his
        priests, until he left him none remaining.

010:012 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was
        at the shearing house in the way,

010:013 Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said,
        Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah;
        and we go down to salute the children of the king and the
        children of the queen.

010:014 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and
        slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty
        men; neither left he any of them.

010:015 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the
        son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said
        to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?
        And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand.
        And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the
        chariot.

010:016 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So
        they made him ride in his chariot.

010:017 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto
        Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the
        saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.

010:018 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,
        Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.

010:019 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
        servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have
        a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting,
        he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent
        that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.

010:020 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
        proclaimed it.

010:021 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of
        Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And
        they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was
        full from one end to another.

010:022 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth
        vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them
        forth vestments.

010:023 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house
        of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and
        look that there be here with you none of the servants of the
        LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.

010:024 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,
        Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the
        men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that
        letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.

010:025 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering
        the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the
        captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they
        smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the
        captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of
        Baal.

010:026 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal,
        and burned them.

010:027 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the
        house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.

010:028 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

010:029 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
        Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the
        golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.

010:030 And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
        executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto
        the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy
        children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of
        Israel.

010:031 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of
        Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins
        of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.

010:032 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael
        smote them in all the coasts of Israel;

010:033 From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and
        the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by
        the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

010:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all
        his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?

010:035 And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in
        Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

010:036 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was
        twenty and eight years.

011:001 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
        dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.

011:002 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
        took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the
        king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and
        his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not
        slain.

011:003 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years.
        And Athaliah did reign over the land.

011:004 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
        hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to
        him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them,
        and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed
        them the king's son.

011:005 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall
        do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall
        even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;

011:006 And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part
        at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of
        the house, that it be not broken down.

011:007 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even
        they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the
        king.

011:008 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his
        weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let
        him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as
        he cometh in.

011:009 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
        that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man
        his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that
        should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

011:010 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
        David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the
        LORD.

011:011 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
        round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to
        the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the
        temple.

011:012 And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon
        him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and
        anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save
        the king.

011:013 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
        people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.

011:014 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as
        the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the
        king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with
        trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason,
        Treason.

011:015 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the
        hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have
        her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill
        with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain
        in the house of the LORD.

011:016 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the
        which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she
        slain.

011:017 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
        the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the
        king also and the people.

011:018 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal,
        and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in
        pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before
        the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house
        of the LORD.

011:019 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and
        the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought
        down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way
        of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on
        the throne of the kings.

011:020 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
        quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's
        house.

011:021 Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.

012:001 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty
        years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
        Zibiah of Beersheba.

012:002 And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
        all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

012:003 But the high places were not taken away: the people still
        sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

012:004 And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the
        dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD,
        even the money of every one that passeth the account, the
        money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh
        into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,

012:005 Let the priests take it to them, every man of his
        acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,
        wheresoever any breach shall be found.

012:006 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king
        Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the
        house.

012:007 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the
        other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the
        breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of
        your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the
        house.

012:008 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the
        people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.

012:009 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the
        lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as
        one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that
        kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into
        the house of the LORD.

012:010 And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the
        chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and
        they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the
        house of the LORD.

012:011 And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them
        that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the
        LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders,
        that wrought upon the house of the LORD,

012:012 And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and
        hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD,
        and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.

012:013 Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of
        silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or
        vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the
        house of the LORD:

012:014 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the
        house of the LORD.

012:015 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
        delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt
        faithfully.

012:016 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the
        house of the LORD: it was the priests'.

012:017 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath,
        and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.

012:018 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
        Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of
        Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the
        gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD,
        and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria:
        and he went away from Jerusalem.

012:019 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

012:020 And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash
        in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.

012:021 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
        Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried
        him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son
        reigned in his stead.

013:001 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah
        king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over
        Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.

013:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and
        followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made
        Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

013:003 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
        delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into
        the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.

013:004 And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto
        him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of
        Syria oppressed them.

013:005 (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out
        from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel
        dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.

013:006 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
        Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there
        remained the grove also in Samaria.)

013:007 Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty
        horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the
        king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the
        dust by threshing.

013:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and
        his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?

013:009 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in
        Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

013:010 In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began
        Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria,
        and reigned sixteen years.

013:011 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he
        departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
        who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.

013:012 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and
        his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah,
        are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?

013:013 And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his
        throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of
        Israel.

013:014 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.
        And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over
        his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of
        Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

013:015 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took
        unto him bow and arrows.

013:016 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the
        bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands
        upon the king's hands.

013:017 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then
        Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the
        LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria:
        for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have
        consumed them.

013:018 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said
        unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote
        thrice, and stayed.

013:019 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou
        shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou
        smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou
        shalt smite Syria but thrice.

013:020 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the
        Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

013:021 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,
        they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the
        sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and
        touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his
        feet.

013:022 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
        Jehoahaz.

013:023 And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on
        them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with
        Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither
        cast he them from his presence as yet.

013:024 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in
        his stead.

013:025 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
        Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out
        of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did
        Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

014:001 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
        reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.

014:002 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

014:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet
        not like David his father: he did according to all things as
        Joash his father did.

014:004 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
        did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.

014:005 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in
        his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king
        his father.

014:006 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto
        that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein
        the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to
        death for the children, nor the children be put to death for
        the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own
        sin.

014:007 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
        Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this
        day.

014:008 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz
        son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one
        another in the face.

014:009 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
        saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
        was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
        and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
        trode down the thistle.

014:010 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted
        thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest
        thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou,
        and Judah with thee?

014:011 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
        went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another
        in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

014:012 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
        every man to their tents.

014:013 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
        of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to
        Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate
        of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

014:014 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
        were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of
        the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.

014:015 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his
        might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they
        not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

014:016 And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria
        with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his
        stead.

014:017 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
        death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

014:018 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in
        the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

014:019 Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he
        fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew
        him there.

014:020 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem
        with his fathers in the city of David.

014:021 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen
        years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.

014:022 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
        slept with his fathers.

014:023 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of
        Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign
        in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.

014:024 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
        who made Israel to sin.

014:025 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath
        unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD
        God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant
        Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of
        Gathhepher.

014:026 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very
        bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any
        helper for Israel.

014:027 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of
        Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of
        Jeroboam the son of Joash.

014:028 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and
        his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and
        Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

014:029 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of
        Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.

015:001 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel
        began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.

015:002 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he
        reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

015:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father Amaziah had done;

015:004 Save that the high places were not removed: the people
        sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.

015:005 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the
        day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the
        king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land.

015:006 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

015:007 So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with
        his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned
        in his stead.

015:008 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did
        Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six
        months.

015:009 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
        his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of
        Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

015:010 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote
        him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

015:011 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

015:012 This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu,
        saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the
        fourth generation. And so it came to pass.

015:013 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
        thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full
        month in Samaria.

015:014 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
        Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and
        slew him, and reigned in his stead.

015:015 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which
        he made, behold, they are written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Israel.

015:016 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
        coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him,
        therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were
        with child he ripped up.

015:017 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
        Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten
        years in Samaria.

015:018 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
        Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

015:019 And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem
        gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be
        with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

015:020 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the
        mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to
        give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned
        back, and stayed not there in the land.

015:021 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

015:022 And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son
        reigned in his stead.

015:023 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son
        of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned
        two years.

015:024 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
        made Israel to sin.

015:025 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
        against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the
        king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of
        the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.

015:026 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
        behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel.

015:027 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah
        the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and
        reigned twenty years.

015:028 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
        made Israel to sin.

015:029 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king
        of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah,
        and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land
        of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.

015:030 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the
        son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in
        his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

015:031 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did,
        behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel.

015:032 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel
        began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.

015:033 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and
        he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
        was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.

015:034 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he
        did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.

015:035 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people
        sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He
        built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.

015:036 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

015:037 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the
        king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

015:038 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son
        reigned in his stead.

016:001 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the
        son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

016:002 Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned
        sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right
        in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.

016:003 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made
        his son to pass through the fire, according to the
        abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from
        before the children of Israel.

016:004 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
        the hills, and under every green tree.

016:005 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of
        Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz,
        but could not overcome him.

016:006 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and
        drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and
        dwelt there unto this day.

016:007 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
        saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out
        of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the
        king of Israel, which rise up against me.

016:008 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house
        of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and
        sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.

016:009 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
        Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the
        people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

016:010 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
        Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz
        sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the
        pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.

016:011 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that
        king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it
        against king Ahaz came from Damascus.

016:012 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the
        altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered
        thereon.

016:013 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and
        poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his
        peace offerings, upon the altar.

016:014 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the
        LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar
        and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the
        altar.

016:015 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the
        great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening
        meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat
        offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the
        land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and
        sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all
        the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for
        me to enquire by.

016:016 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
        commanded.

016:017 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed
        the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the
        brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon the pavement
        of stones.

016:018 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the
        house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house
        of the LORD for the king of Assyria.

016:019 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

016:020 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in
        his stead.

017:001 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son
        of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.

017:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but
        not as the kings of Israel that were before him.

017:003 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
        became his servant, and gave him presents.

017:004 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had
        sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to
        the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore
        the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.

017:005 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
        went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.

017:006 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,
        and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah
        and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
        Medes.

017:007 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against
        the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land
        of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
        had feared other gods,

017:008 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast
        out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of
        Israel, which they had made.

017:009 And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were
        not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high
        places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to
        the fenced city.

017:010 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and
        under every green tree:

017:011 And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did
        the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and
        wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:

017:012 For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye
        shall not do this thing.

017:013 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by
        all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from
        your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes,
        according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and
        which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.

017:014 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,
        like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the
        LORD their God.

017:015 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
        with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified
        against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and
        went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning
        whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like
        them.

017:016 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and
        made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove,
        and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.

017:017 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
        the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold
        themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him
        to anger.

017:018 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed
        them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of
        Judah only.

017:019 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God,
        but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.

017:020 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted
        them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he
        had cast them out of his sight.

017:021 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made
        Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from
        following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.

017:022 For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
        which he did; they departed not from them;

017:023 Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said
        by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away
        out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.

017:024 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from
        Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim,
        and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the
        children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in
        the cities thereof.

017:025 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that
        they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among
        them, which slew some of them.

017:026 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The
        nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of
        Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore
        he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them,
        because they know not the manner of the God of the land.

017:027 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one
        of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go
        and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God
        of the land.

017:028 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from
        Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they
        should fear the LORD.

017:029 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in
        the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made,
        every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.

017:030 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth
        made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,

017:031 And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites
        burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech,
        the gods of Sepharvaim.

017:032 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the
        lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed
        for them in the houses of the high places.

017:033 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the
        manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.

017:034 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not
        the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their
        ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD
        commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;

017:035 With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them,
        saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to
        them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:

017:036 But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with
        great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and
        him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.

017:037 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
        commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do
        for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.

017:038 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not
        forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.

017:039 But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you
        out of the hand of all your enemies.

017:040 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
        manner.

017:041 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven
        images, both their children, and their children's children: as
        did their fathers, so do they unto this day.

018:001 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah
        king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah
        began to reign.

018:002 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and
        he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's
        name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.

018:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that David his father did.

018:004 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down
        the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses
        had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn
        incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.

018:005 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was
        none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were
        before him.

018:006 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,
        but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.

018:007 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he
        went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and
        served him not.

018:008 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders
        thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

018:009 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
        was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
        that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and
        besieged it.

018:010 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth
        year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of
        Israel, Samaria was taken.

018:011 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria,
        and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and
        in the cities of the Medes:

018:012 Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but
        transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of
        the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.

018:013 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib
        king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of
        Judah, and took them.

018:014 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
        Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which
        thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria
        appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of
        silver and thirty talents of gold.

018:015 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the
        house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.

018:016 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of
        the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah
        king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of
        Assyria.

018:017 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
        from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against
        Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when
        they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the
        upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.

018:018 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them
        Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and
        Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.

018:019 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
        saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
        this wherein thou trustest?

018:020 Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and
        strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou
        rebellest against me?

018:021 Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised
        reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into
        his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all
        that trust on him.

018:022 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not
        that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath
        taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall
        worship before this altar in Jerusalem?

018:023 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king
        of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if
        thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

018:024 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
        least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
        chariots and for horsemen?

018:025 Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to
        destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and
        destroy it.

018:026 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah,
        unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the
        Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in
        the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the
        wall.

018:027 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
        master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me
        to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own
        dung, and drink their own piss with you?

018:028 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
        language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king,
        the king of Assyria:

018:029 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
        shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:

018:030 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
        LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be
        delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

018:031 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
        Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me,
        and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of
        his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his
        cistern:

018:032 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
        land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land
        of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and
        hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The
        LORD will deliver us.

018:033 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
        out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

018:034 Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods
        of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out
        of mine hand?

018:035 Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have
        delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should
        deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?

018:036 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word:
        for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

018:037 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
        household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph
        the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told
        him the words of Rabshakeh.

019:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
        his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
        the house of the LORD.

019:002 And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna
        the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with
        sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

019:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
        of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are
        come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

019:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of
        Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to
        reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the
        LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the
        remnant that are left.

019:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

019:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master,
        Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou
        hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria
        have blasphemed me.

019:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
        rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him
        to fall by the sword in his own land.

019:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
        against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
        Lachish.

019:009 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he
        is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again
        unto Hezekiah, saying,

019:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not
        thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem
        shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

019:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
        all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be
        delivered?

019:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
        have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
        children of Eden which were in Thelasar?

019:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the
        king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?

019:014 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the
        messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house
        of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

019:015 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of
        Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the
        God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou
        hast made heaven and earth.

019:016 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes,
        and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent
        him to reproach the living God.

019:017 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the
        nations and their lands,

019:018 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods,
        but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
        have destroyed them.

019:019 Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us
        out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know
        that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.

019:020 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus
        saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to
        me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.

019:021 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
        virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed
        thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head
        at thee.

019:022 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
        hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
        even against the Holy One of Israel.

019:023 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast
        said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the
        height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut
        down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees
        thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders,
        and into the forest of his Carmel.

019:024 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of
        my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.

019:025 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of
        ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
        pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into
        ruinous heaps.

019:026 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
        dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field,
        and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as
        corn blasted before it be grown up.

019:027 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
        and thy rage against me.

019:028 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into
        mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my
        bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
        which thou camest.

019:029 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year
        such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that
        which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and
        reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.

019:030 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
        yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

019:031 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
        escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall
        do this.

019:032 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
        He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
        nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.

019:033 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
        shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

019:034 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake,
        and for my servant David's sake.

019:035 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD
        went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred
        fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the
        morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

019:036 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
        returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

019:037 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
        Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
        him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia.
        And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

020:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet
        Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus
        saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die,
        and not live.

020:002 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
        saying,

020:003 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before
        thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that
        which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

020:004 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle
        court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,

020:005 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus
        saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy
        prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on
        the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.

020:006 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver
        thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and
        I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant
        David's sake.

020:007 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid
        it on the boil, and he recovered.

020:008 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the
        LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of
        the LORD the third day?

020:009 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that
        the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the
        shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?

020:010 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to
        go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward
        ten degrees.

020:011 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the
        shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the
        dial of Ahaz.

020:012 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
        Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had
        heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

020:013 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the
        house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and
        the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of
        his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was
        nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah
        shewed them not.

020:014 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
        him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
        And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from
        Babylon.

020:015 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
        answered, All the things that are in mine house have they
        seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not
        shewed them.

020:016 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.

020:017 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and
        that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day,
        shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith
        the LORD.

020:018 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
        beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
        palace of the king of Babylon.

020:019 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
        which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace
        and truth be in my days?

020:020 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and
        how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the
        city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
        the kings of Judah?

020:021 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son
        reigned in his stead.

021:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Hephzibah.

021:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after
        the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before
        the children of Israel.

021:003 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his
        father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and
        made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all
        the host of heaven, and served them.

021:004 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the
        LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.

021:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
        courts of the house of the LORD.

021:006 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,
        and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and
        wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD,
        to provoke him to anger.

021:007 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
        house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his
        son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out
        of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

021:008 Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of
        the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe
        to do according to all that I have commanded them, and
        according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.

021:009 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more
        evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the
        children of Israel.

021:010 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,

021:011 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations,
        and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which
        were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his
        idols:

021:012 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am
        bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever
        heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.

021:013 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
        plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a
        man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.

021:014 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and
        deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall
        become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;

021:015 Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and
        have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came
        forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.

021:016 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
        filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin
        wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil
        in the sight of the LORD.

021:017 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and
        his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of
        the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

021:018 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
        garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his
        son reigned in his stead.

021:019 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and
        he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
        Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

021:020 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
        his father Manasseh did.

021:021 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
        served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:

021:022 And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in
        the way of the LORD.

021:023 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the
        king in his own house.

021:024 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
        against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
        son king in his stead.

021:025 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

021:026 And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and
        Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

022:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.

022:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
        walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not
        aside to the right hand or to the left.

022:003 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,
        that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of
        Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,

022:004 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver
        which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers
        of the door have gathered of the people:

022:005 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the
        work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and
        let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the
        house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,

022:006 Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber
        and hewn stone to repair the house.

022:007 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money
        that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt
        faithfully.

022:008 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I
        have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
        Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

022:009 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
        word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money
        that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the
        hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the
        house of the LORD.

022:010 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the
        priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before
        the king.

022:011 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
        book of the law, that he rent his clothes.

022:012 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son
        of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the
        scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,

022:013 Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for
        all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found:
        for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us,
        because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this
        book, to do according unto all that which is written
        concerning us.

022:014 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan,
        and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of
        Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the
        wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and
        they communed with her.

022:015 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
        Tell the man that sent you to me,

022:016 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
        place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of
        the book which the king of Judah hath read:

022:017 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
        other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
        works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled
        against this place, and shall not be quenched.

022:018 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the
        LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of
        Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;

022:019 Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself
        before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this
        place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should
        become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes,
        and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.

022:020 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and
        thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes
        shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.
        And they brought the king word again.

023:001 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders
        of Judah and of Jerusalem.

023:002 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
        men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him,
        and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both
        small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of
        the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the
        LORD.

023:003 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the
        LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and
        his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all
        their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were
        written in this book. And all the people stood to the
        covenant.

023:004 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the
        priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to
        bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that
        were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of
        heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of
        Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.

023:005 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of
        Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the
        cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them
        also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the
        moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
